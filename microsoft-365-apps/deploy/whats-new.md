## November 2022

### Basic authentication prompts to be blocked by default in Microsoft 365 Apps

To help improve security in Microsoft 365 Apps, we’re changing its default behavior to block sign-in prompts from Basic authentication. With this change, if users try to open files on servers that only use Basic authentication, they won't see any Basic authentication sign-in prompts. Instead, they'll see a message that the file has been blocked because it uses a sign-in method that may be unsecure.

This change will begin rolling out in January 2023, starting with Version 2209. For more information, see [Basic authentication sign-in prompts are blocked by default in Microsoft 365 Apps](../security/basic-authentication-prompts-blocked.md).

## November 2021

### Retirement of Security Policy Advisor

> [!NOTE]
> Security Policy Advisor has been retired and is no longer available in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center, as of January 28, 2022. If you had configured security policies, they've been migrated to the [Office cloud policy service](../admin-center/overview-cloud-policy.md) and you can manage them there.

Security Policy Advisor is no longer available to accept new tenants to manage Office cloud security policies. Also, Security Policy Advisor will be disabled for all tenants who haven't previously deployed a policy with Security Policy Advisor.

If you're already using Security Policy Advisor, we recommend migrating your security policies to the Office cloud policy service to avoid any interruption in managing them. For more information, see [Manually migrate security policies from Security Policy Advisor to the Office cloud policy service](../admin-center/overview-cloud-policy.md).

### Performance recommendations for Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 10

When a Microsoft 365 user experiences poor performance using any of the core Office applications (such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook), it can have an impact on their productivity. There are many factors that customers can influence directly that can also impact the end-user experience.

We've published a new "best practices from the field" article that will help you understand these factors and provide recommendations that will allow you to take the appropriate steps necessary to provide your end users with successful performance on the Microsoft 365 platform.

For more information, see [Performance recommendations for Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 10](../best-practices/performance-recommendations.md).

## September 2021

Office LTSC 2021 is generally available to volume licensed customers as of September 16, 2021. If you've deployed Microsoft 365 Apps to users in your organization, you don't need Office LTSC 2021. You already have all the features that are included in Office LTSC 2021, along with many more features that aren't in Office LTSC 2021. 

For more information, see [Overview of Office LTSC 2021](/office/ltsc/2021/overview) and [Office LTSC is now generally available](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2021/09/16/office-ltsc-is-now-generally-available/).

After deploying Microsoft 365 Apps, you can change the update channel for a device by using Group Policy or the Office Deployment Tool (ODT). For example, you can move a device from Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel to Monthly Enterprise Channel. We've published a new article that covers how to change the update channel. For more information, see [Change the Microsoft 365 Apps update channel for devices in your organization](../updates/change-update-channels.md).

## October 2019

## September 2019

### Windows 7 end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps
***Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020.*** Using Microsoft 365 Apps on older, unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. Therefore, if your organization is using Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 7, we strongly recommend your organization moves those devices to [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support?rtc=1#office-ContentAreaHeadingTemplate-s9f0ou1).

Even though Windows 7 is longer supported, we've decided to continue to provide you with security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps for the next three years, until January 2023. For more information, see [Windows 7 end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps](../end-of-support/windows-7-support.md).

### Delivery Optimization and Microsoft 365 Apps
Delivery Optimization is a peer-to-peer distribution technology available in Windows 10 that allows devices to share content, such as updates, that the devices have downloaded from Microsoft over the internet. Delivery Optimization can help reduce network bandwidth because a device can get portions of the update from another device on its local network instead of having to download the update completely from Microsoft.

Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 10 can take advantage of Delivery Optimization during installation and when receiving updates, if certain requirements are met. For more information, see [Delivery Optimization and Microsoft 365 Apps](../updates/delivery-optimization.md).

For more information, see [Change a Microsoft 365 Apps installation from 32-bit to 64-bit](change-bitness.md).

### General availability of Office cloud policy service
The Office cloud policy service is now generally available.  It's a cloud-based service that enables you to enforce policy preferences for Microsoft 365 Apps on a user's device, even if the device isn't domain joined or otherwise managed. The policy preferences roam to whichever device the user signs into and uses Microsoft 365 Apps.

For more information, see [Overview of the Office cloud policy service for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](../admin-center/overview-cloud-policy.md).

The policy preferences roam to whichever device the user signs into and uses Microsoft 365 Apps.

For more information, see the following resources:
 - [Announcing the new cloud-based policy management service for Office 365 ProPlus](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Blog/Announcing-the-new-cloud-based-policy-management-service-for/ba-p/310405)
 - [Overview of the Office cloud policy service](../admin-center/overview-cloud-policy.md)

### Office for Mac available in the Mac App Store

## September 2018

Office 2019 is the latest version of Microsoft's productivity software that's available as a one-time purchase from a retail store or through a volume licensing agreement. Office 2019 is separate from Office that's available through Office 365 (or Microsoft 365) plans. For example, if you've deployed Microsoft 365 Apps to the users in your organization, you don't need Office 2019. You already have all the features, and many more, that are included in Office 2019. For more information, see [Overview of Office 2019](/office/2019/overview) and [Deploy Office 2019](/office/2019/deploy).

## July 2018

You can now  use the Office Deployment Tool to apply application preferences to Microsoft 365 Apps as part of an initial deployment or as an update to existing installations of Office. For more information, see [Apply application preferences to Microsoft 365 Apps](overview-office-deployment-tool.md#apply-application-preferences-to-microsoft-365-apps).

## June 2018

To help you uninstall versions of Office that use Windows Installer (MSI) as the installation technology, you can now use the Office Deployment Tool and specify the RemoveMSI element in your configuration.xml file. For more information, see [Remove existing MSI versions of Office when upgrading to Microsoft 365 Apps](upgrade-from-msi-version.md).

For best practices for planning your deployment of Microsoft 365 Apps, see [Assess your environment and requirements for deploying Microsoft 365 Apps](assess-microsoft-365-apps.md) and [Plan your enterprise deployment of Microsoft 365 Apps](plan-microsoft-365-apps.md).
