Arm-based devices require Windows 11 or later to run Microsoft 365 Apps. The 32-bit version of Microsoft 365 Apps isn't supported on these devices. When you install the 64-bit version on an Arm-based device, it automatically includes the Arm-optimized components, improving performance and ensuring compatibility with the Arm architecture.
