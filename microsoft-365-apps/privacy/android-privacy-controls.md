# Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Office on Android devices

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of Office products covered by this privacy information, see [Privacy controls available for Office products](products-versions-privacy-controls.md).

There are policy settings for Office on Android devices that allow you to control settings related to the following:

- ***Diagnostic data*** that is collected and sent to Microsoft about Office client software being used.

- ***Connected experiences*** that use cloud-based functionality to provide enhanced Office features to you and your users.

For more information about diagnostic data and connected experiences, see [Overview of privacy controls](overview-privacy-controls.md).

## Policy settings available for Office on Android devices

The following table lists which policy settings are available for Office on Android devices and a link to additional information about each policy setting.

> [!NOTE]
>- The additional information provided covers the policy settings for Office on devices running Windows. But the same information applies to Office on Android devices because they are the same policy settings.
>- The *Allow the use of connected experiences in Office* policy setting that's available for Office on devices running Windows does not apply to Office on Android devices.

## Use Cloud Policy to apply policy settings

To apply any of these four policy settings for Office on Android devices, you need to use Cloud Policy. For more information on using Cloud Policy, see [Overview of Cloud Policy service for Microsoft 365](../admincenter/overview-cloud-policy.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously used Cloud Policy to configure these policy settings for Office on devices running Windows, those same settings will apply to Office on Android devices. For that to happen, you just need to sign in to Cloud Policy and the service will apply the settings automatically to Office on Android devices.
