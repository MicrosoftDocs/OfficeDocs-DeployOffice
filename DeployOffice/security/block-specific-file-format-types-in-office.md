# Block specific file format types in Office 2016

 **Summary:** Provides information about the settings to block specific file format types for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word users. 


You can block specific types of files from being opened or saved in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word by configuring settings in either Group Policy or the Office Customization Tool (OCT).

File block settings are most frequently used to:

- Force an organization to use specific file formats.

- Mitigate zero-day security attacks by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files. Zero-day security attacks are attacks that occur between the time that vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack becomes available.

- Prevent an organization from opening files that were saved in earlier and pre-release Office formats.

## Planning considerations for configuring file block settings

Here are some things to think about as you plan your file block settings:

- Decide whether you want users to be able to change your configurations. 

  - If you do not want users to be able to change your configurations, use Group Policy to configure file block settings  *policies*  . 

  - If you do want users to be able to change your configurations, use the OCT to set file block settings  *preferences*  . If you use the OCT to set file block settings, users can change these settings by using the Trust Center. The Trust Center is available to them from the **File** tab in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. From the **File** tab, they choose **Options**, then **Trust Center**. From the Trust Center, they choose **Trust Center Settings** and then **File Block Settings**.

- Block open settings do not apply to files that are opened from trusted locations.

- Block file format settings are application specific. You can't prevent users from using other applications to open or save file types or formats that are blocked. For example, you can enable block file format settings that prevent users from opening .dot files in Word 2016, but users will still be able to open .dot files by using Publisher 2013 because Publisher 2013 uses a converter to read the .dot file.

- If Message Bar notifications are disabled, the block file format warning dialog box will still appear if the user tries to open a blocked file type. Examples of file types that you can block from opening are Word 2007 or later documents or templates, or PowerPoint outline files, among many other files types.

## Group Policy and OCT settings

This section describes how to find the settings in Group Policy and the OCT, and lists the settings for Excel 2016, PowerPoint 2016, and Word 2016.

The locations in the Group Policy Editor that are presented in this article apply when you open the Group Policy Editor to edit a GPO. To edit local Group Policy, use the Local Group Policy Editor. To edit domain-based Group Policy, use the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). Either tool opens the Group Policy Editor when you edit a GPO.

### How to find the settings

-  Group Policy settings are available under the **User Configuration/Administrative Templates** node of the Local Group Policy Editor. 

- OCT policy settings are available on the OCT **Modify user settings** page. 

In both Group Policy and the OCT, the specific path of the folder that contains the file block settings for Excel 2016, PowerPoint 2016, and Word 2016 is the same, except for the application name:

- Excel 2016 file block settings:

    **Microsoft Excel 2016\Excel Options\Security\Trust Center\File Block Settings**

- PowerPoint 2016 file block settings:

    **Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\PowerPoint Options\Security\Trust Center\File Block Settings**

- Word 2016 file block settings:

    **Microsoft Word 2016\Word Options\Security\Trust Center\File Block Settings**

By default, users can set default file block settings in the Trust Center for Excel 2016, PowerPoint 2016, and Word 2016. In Word 2016, for example, on the **File** tab, users can choose **Options**, **Trust Center**, **Trust Center Settings**, and then choose **File Block Settings**. 

You can disable the file block options in Trust Center options by configuring the settings through Group Policy. If you configure the settings through the OCT, users can change file type behavior through the Trust Center. For more information, see [What is File Block?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=195498)

<a name="SetDefaultBehavior"> </a>

### About the Set default file block behavior setting

The **Set default file block behavior** setting specifies any of the following: 

- How blocked files open

- How they don't open

- How they open in protected view but can't be edited

- How they open in protected view and can be edited

If you enable this setting, the default file block behavior that you specify applies to any file format that users block by using the Trust Center. The Set default file block setting can also apply to a specific file format if you enable that file format setting  *and*  select the **Open/Save blocked, use open policy** option. For more information about individual file format settings, see the tables in this article. Otherwise, if you configure a single file format setting, that setting overrides the **Set default file block behavior** setting configuration for that file type. 

> [!NOTE]
> The options under **Open behavior for selected types** in the Trust Center, under **File Block Settings**, correspond directly to the options in the **Set default file block behavior** setting. You can disable these UI options for users by enabling the **Set default file block behavior** setting in Group Policy.
