# Let Mac users choose Office Insider for themselves by using Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU)

If you want your Mac users to choose an Office Insider channel for themselves, they can follow these steps on their Mac.

1. Open any Office app, such as Word, and then select **Check for Updates** on the **Help** menu.
2. In the **Microsoft AutoUpdate** dialog that appears, select **Advanced...**
3. Select either **Current Channel (Preview)** or **Beta Channel** for the update channel.

> [!NOTE]
> - Keep in mind that Beta Channel isn't supported.
> - By default, Microsoft AutoUpdate automatically checks for updates every 12 hours.
> - If you want to choose the Office Insider channel for your Mac users, you can [use a preference](preference.md).
