# Update exclusion dates

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is pre-release documentation for a preview program that isn’t available to everyone and is subject to change.

## Overview

Update exclusions can be created to prevent devices downloading security and feature updates during specific dates. Update exclusions allow you to reduce change in your environment during busy periods, such as during tax season or at the end of the financial year. Manual actions in Action Center and end-user actions are unaffected by update exclusion dates.

> [!NOTE]
> Update exclusions prevent devices downloading security and feature updates. If you also want to prevent devices installing updates, consider starting the exclusion sooner and enforcing installations with an [update deadline](update-deadline.md).

## Limitations

Update exclusions start and end at 00:00 UTC on the specified dates, not local device time.
