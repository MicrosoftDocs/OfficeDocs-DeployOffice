# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Add Account and Account Settings dialog box

**Applies to:** *Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016*

If you are adding a new account, select the type of account to add, and then choose **Next**.
  
In the **\<account type\> Settings** dialog box, set the options appropriate for the type of account that you are adding or modifying. Choose **More Settings** for additional configuration options. Choose **Finish** when you are done. 
  
To ensure that e-mail services do not overlap, Outlook might not allow you to add more than one new account for the same type of service. For example, Outlook verifies that all POP accounts have unique names. The following table shows how Outlook determines whether a new account of the same type as an existing account can be added to the Setup customization file.

|**POP3** <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Account name  <br/> |
|**IMAP** <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Account name  <br/> |
