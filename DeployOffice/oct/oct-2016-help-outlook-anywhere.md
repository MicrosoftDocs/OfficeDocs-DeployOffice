# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Outlook Anywhere

If you select **Configure Outlook Anywhere**, and then select **Connect to Exchange Mailbox using HTTP**, you can configure the following options: 
  
- **Use this URL to connect to the proxy server for Exchange** - Server name URL for the Outlook Anywhere proxy server. Do not enter http://or https:// as part of the name. The appropriate entry (http:// or https://) is included automatically in the box after you enter the name, based on the authentication settings you choose. 
    
- **Connect using SSL only** - Select this option to connect using Secured Sockets Layer only. If you want to support both server authentication and client authentication, select: 
    
  - **Mutually authenticate the session when connecting with SSL** - If this is enabled, enter the **Principal name for proxy server**.
    
- **On fast network, connect using HTTP first, then connect using TCP/IP** - On a fast network, connect using Outlook Anywhere (HTTP) first instead of the default LAN (TCP/IP). 
    
- **On slow network, connect using HTTP first, then connect using TCP/IP** - On a slow network, connect using Outlook Anywhere (HTTP) first instead of the default LAN (TCP/IP). 
    
- **Use this authentication when connecting to the proxy server for Exchange** - The default method is Password Authentication (NTLM).
