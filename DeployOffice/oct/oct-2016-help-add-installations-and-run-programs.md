# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Add installations and run programs

**Applies to:** *Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016*

**Summary**: Runs additional executable programs before or after the Office installation is complete.
  
Setup runs all command lines in the order listed and doesn't complete the installation until all command lines are executed.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Do not add a program that requires that the computer restart, unless it is the last program in the list. If a custom program restarts the computer, the Office installation will be completed. Any custom programs that appear later in this list will not be run.
  
To add a program to the list, choose **Add**. To modify a program, select it, and then choose **Modify**. To remove a program, select it, and then choose **Remove**. To change the order of the list, select a program, and then choose the **Move** arrows to move the program up or down in the list.
