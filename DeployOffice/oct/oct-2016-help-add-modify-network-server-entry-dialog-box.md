# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Add/Modify Network Server Entry dialog box

**Applies to:** *Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016*

The **Add Network Server Entry** dialog box opens when you choose **Add** on the **Additional network sources** page. If you select an entry on the **Additional network sources** page, and then choose **Modify**, the **Modify Network Server Entry** dialog box opens. 
  
In the **Add Network Server Entry** or **Modify Network Server Entry** dialog boxes, in the **Network server** box, type the path and name of the server. You can use a UNC path or, if all users have access to the server with the same drive letter, you can use a drive letter in the path. The path can contain environment variables delimited by percent signs (%) if they are defined for all users. For example: 
  
 z:\office
    
 \\\server1\share\office_root
    
 %USERNAME%\office_root
    
 %USERNAME%\office_root
    
You can also choose **Browse** to search for a server on the network.
