# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Export settings

**Applies to:** *Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016*

**Summary**: Saves the existing Outlook profile settings to a PRF file.
  
Choose **Export Profile Settings**. In the **Save As** dialog box, type a name for the new PRF file, and then choose **Save**. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> An efficient way to create an Outlook PRF file is to use the OCT to make your selections, and then export them to a PRF file - even if you are not using a Setup customization file when you deploy Office. You can edit the PRF file to make additional customizations not exposed in the OCT. For example, you can add an e-mail provider not listed in the OCT.
