# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Remove files

**Applies to:** *Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016*

**Summary**: Removes files from users' computers when Office is installed.
  
Files listed in the **Remove files** list are removed from the user's computer before files listed in the **Add files** list are installed. Therefore, you can delete existing files on a user's computer and replace them with new versions. If the target file on a user's computer has been renamed or modified, an added file with the same name does not replace it. 
  
To create a list of files to remove from the user's computer during installation, choose **Add**. To modify the path or name of a file, select the file in the **Remove files** list, and then choose **Modify**. To remove a file from the list, select the file, and then choose **Remove**. You can use the SHIFT and CTRL keys to select multiple files at one time.
