# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Modify Address Book Settings dialog box

Configure the default way in which Outlook keeps the offline Address Book updated. Select among the following options:
  
- **Download changes since last Send/Receive** - Outlook downloads only the changes that have been made to the Address Book since the last Send/Receive. This generally takes less time to download than downloading the entire Address Book. 
    
- **Full Details** - When downloading the Address Book, Outlook copies all of the details for each entry. 
    
- **No Details** - When the address book is downloaded, Outlook copies only essential information, such as the name and e-mail address for each entry. This takes less time to download, but address details are not included in the offline address book. This is a legacy option supported by Outlook Address Book (OAB) versions 2.0 and 3.0. If Outlook connects to a server that supports OAB 4.0 or later, the full details will be downloaded even if this option is checked.
