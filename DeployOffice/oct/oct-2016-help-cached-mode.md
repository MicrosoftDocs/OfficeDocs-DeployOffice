# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Cached Mode

Use the following options to configure users' Outlook profiles to use a local copy of the Exchange mailbox. 
  
 **Do not configure Cached Exchange Mode** - By default, Exchange mailboxes can be accessed from the Exchange Server computer, instead of being cached on users' computers in an offline Outlook Data File (.ost). 
  
 **Configure Cached Exchange Mode** - Create an .ost file or use an existing .ost file. Users work with a local copy of their Exchange mailbox. 
  
If you select **Use Cached Exchange Mode**, you can configure Cached Exchange Mode for users by using the following options: 
  
- **Download only headers** - Download copies of headers only from users' Exchange mailboxes. 
    
- **Download headers followed by the full item** - Download copies of headers from users' Exchange mailboxes and download copies of messages. 
    
- **Download full items** - Download copies of full messages (headers and message bodies) from users' Exchange mailboxes. 
    
- **On slow connections, download only headers** - When a slow network connection is detected, download copies of headers only from users' Exchange mailboxes. 
    
- **Download shared non-mail folders** - Download shared non-mail folders from other users' mailboxes. 
    
- **Download Public Folder Favorites** - Download the list of Public Folder Favorites. 
    
- **Customize location for .ost and .oab files**
    
  - **Path and file name of the Outlook data (.ost) file** - Specify the name and where the offline Outlook data file should be stored. 
    
  - **Directory path to store Offline Address Book files** - Specify the path where the offline Address Book files should be stored.
