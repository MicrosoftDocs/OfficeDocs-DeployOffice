# Overview of optional connected experiences in Office

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of Office products covered by this privacy information, see [Privacy controls available for Office products](products-versions-privacy-controls.md).

If you have a work or school account, your organization's admin may have provided you with the ability to use one or more cloud-backed services (also referred to as "optional connected experiences") while using the Office apps, like Word or Excel, that are included with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (previously named Office 365 ProPlus). These cloud-backed services are optional. Whether you use them is up to you. They are provided to you under the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/). In some cases, other terms may also apply. This article lists the cloud-backed services, further explains their terms of use, and describes how you can turn them off or on at any time.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, see the following articles to learn how to give or restrict your users' ability to use optional connected experiences:
> - [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](manage-privacy-controls.md)
> - [Use preferences to manage privacy controls for Office for Mac](mac-privacy-preferences.md)
> - [Use preferences to manage privacy controls for Office on iOS devices](ios-privacy-preferences.md)
> - [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Office on Android devices](android-privacy-controls.md)
> - [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Office for the web applications](office-web-privacy-controls.md)
>
> Most optional connected experiences also can be managed by the privacy controls for connected experiences. For example, Insert Online Pictures can also be managed by the *Allow the use of connected experiences in Office that download online content* policy setting.

### If you use these services, what terms of use do you need to agree to?

It is important to know that these optional cloud-backed services are not covered by your organization's license with Microsoft. Instead, they are licensed directly to you. By using these optional cloud-backed services, you also agree to the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/). Depending on which service you use, additional terms may also apply. In most cases, there is no fee to use these services. If a fee does apply (as may be the case with some [Office add-ins](https://support.microsoft.com/office/16278816-1948-4028-91E5-76DCA5380F8D) available to you for download through Office Store), you will be clearly informed prior to use.

## Experiences that rely on Bing

Some cloud-backed services are powered by Microsoft Bing. Microsoft Bing is a separate business to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and is managed independently of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise by Microsoft. The experiences it powers in Office apps included with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise are: [3D Maps](https://support.microsoft.com/office/6b56a50d-3c3e-4a9e-a527-eea62a387030), [Map Charts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f2cfed55-d622-42cd-8ec9-ec8a358b593b), [Insert Online Pictures](https://support.microsoft.com/office/3C51EDF4-22E1-460A-B372-9329A8724344), [Insert Online 3D Models](https://support.microsoft.com/office/ec5feb79-b0af-47f6-a885-151fcc88ac0a), [PowerPoint QuickStarter](https://support.microsoft.com/office/4784f273-0b2c-456c-9c89-24e5b977c224), [Researcher](https://support.microsoft.com/office/1728f286-8702-4d72-8169-ab7677ca0e1f), [Smart Lookup](https://support.microsoft.com/office/debf2083-5ac0-4739-8667-ae2467bec044), and [similarity checker](https://support.microsoft.com/office/6d942360-b5ca-445f-a84d-6e8c66fc40d2) (a feature of Editor).

Bing powers the following experiences in Outlook for iOS and Android:

- **Location suggestions:**   When you add a public place with a street address to a calendar item, the full street address is included in the Location field.
- **Interesting Calendars:**   You can [subscribe](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cff1429c-5af6-41ec-a5b4-74f2c278e98c) to calendars about your favorite sports teams or TV shows.
- **Travel time in Up Next:** Your next upcoming event will be summarized at the top of your email inbox in a card called [Up Next](https://www.osupportweb.com/a/outlook-mobile/?s=up-next&f=how-does-up-next-work). In Outlook for Android, this experience requires Bing Maps to provide estimated travel time.

 These experiences that rely on Bing are licensed to you under the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and covered by the [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/). Any search queries you provide to the Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise organization while using these services are sent to Microsoft Bing. They are not linked to you by the Bing organization.

## Experiences that rely on LinkedIn

[Resume Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/office/444ff6f0-ef74-4a9c-9091-ffd7a9d1917a) provides an experience in Word that is powered by LinkedIn. It delivers ideas for your resume. LinkedIn is a different company that is owned by Microsoft. If you use Resume Assistant, the LinkedIn [user agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement) and [privacy policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) apply in addition to the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/). Any search queries you provide to the Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise organization while using these services are sent to LinkedIn. They are not linked to you by the LinkedIn organization. You do not need to have a LinkedIn account to use this cloud-backed service.

Note: The privacy setting described below does not control experiences that require you to connect your LinkedIn account to your Microsoft work or school account. To control these types of experiences (such as the LinkedIn information on a [profile card](https://support.microsoft.com/office/e80f931f-5fc4-4a59-ba6e-c1e35a85b501) in Outlook), see [LinkedIn in Microsoft apps and services](https://support.microsoft.com/office/dc81cc70-4d64-4755-9f1c-b9536e34d381).

## Experiences that rely on other Microsoft-owned online services and/or services owned by third-parties

### Help > Contact Support

On Outlook for iOS and Android, you can report issues and connect with our support team through **Settings** > **Help & Feedback** > **Contact Support**. This experience requires a Microsoft owned service called PowerLift, and the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [Microsoft privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/) apply.

### Help > Suggest a Feature

Suggest a Feature is an experience that allows you to submit your ideas regarding your use of Outlook or Excel. Your suggestions are provided directly to a third-party service called UserVoice. If you submit ideas using Suggest a Feature, the [terms of service](https://outlook.uservoice.com/tos) and [privacy policy](https://outlook.uservoice.com/tos#privacy-policy) of UserVoice will apply.

### Insert online video

[Insert Online Video](https://support.microsoft.com/office/8340EC69-4CEE-4FE1-AB96-4849154BC6DB) allows you to insert video files into your document. The insert online video experience is subject to the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/). Additional terms of use may apply if you access content from third-party sources. For example, when you connect to YouTube, its [terms of use](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and [privacy statement](https://policies.google.com/privacy) will apply. Microsoft may add other providers of video material in the future.

### Microsoft Error Reporting Program (MERP) 

MERP connects to the Watson.microsoft.com service to send diagnostic data when Office client applications that run on Mac devices crash. It is owned by Microsoft and the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [Microsoft privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/) apply. MERP does not apply to Office client applications that run on Windows.

### Office Store 

When you use the Office Store, your use of the store site itself is licensed by the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/). However, any [Office add-ins](https://support.microsoft.com/office/16278816-1948-4028-91E5-76DCA5380F8D) that you download through the Office Store are covered by the add-in provider's terms of use. These providers can be various different organizations or businesses, and some may charge a usage fee. You will need to check the permissions, privacy statement, and license terms of each add-in to know which terms apply and decide if you want to agree to the terms of use that organization offers.

> [!NOTE]
> - The administrator in your organization might provide you with add-ins, even if you don’t choose to use the Office Store.
> - If you’re an administrator, for more information about add-ins, see the “Optional connected experiences” section in [Privacy and security for Office Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/privacy-and-security) and [Privacy, permissions, and security for Outlook add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/privacy-and-security).

### Research

[Research](https://support.microsoft.com/office/b862efc5-9a7b-4f88-a23d-93712d6e4397) connects to cloud-backed services to obtain dictionary, thesaurus, translation, and word lookup results. When you use this experience, it connects to Microsoft-owned services by default and the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/) apply. Research allows you to add other service providers. If you decide to use another service provider, additional terms may apply.

> [!NOTE]
> Research is different than Researcher. In newer versions of Office, another experience called Researcher is available in addition to Research. Researcher is a newer service, powered by Bing, and is discussed above under [Experiences that rely on Bing](#experiences-that-rely-on-bing).

### Travel time in Up Next in Outlook for iOS

On Outlook for iOS, your next upcoming event will be summarized at the top of your email inbox in a card called [Up Next](https://www.osupportweb.com/a/outlook-mobile/?s=up-next&f=how-does-up-next-work). This experience requires an Apple owned service called Apple Maps to provide estimated travel time. The Apple Maps [terms of use](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/maps/) and Apple [privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy) apply.

### Weather Bar in Outlook

The [Weather Bar](https://support.microsoft.com/office/d11b7532-7c58-489e-8103-5cc5d727b06b) in Outlook displays weather forecasts for geographic locations you choose. During use, the Weather Bar in Outlook connects to MSN Weather by default. MSN is owned by Microsoft and the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [Microsoft privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/) apply. When you use the Weather Bar with MSN Weather, Microsoft does not detect your location and the cities that you choose to display are not linkable to you. You may [change this default setting](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/client-developer/outlook/weather/extending-the-weather-bar-in-outlook) to connect to other weather service providers. If you decide to use another weather service provider, you will need to check the privacy statement and license terms of that provider to know which terms apply.

## How to determine if your admin has given you the ability to use optional connected experiences

To determine whether your admin has given you the ability to use any optional connected experiences in your Office apps included with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise on a Windows device, go to **File** > **Account** > **Account Privacy** and select **Manage Settings**. If your admin has not given you control, you will see a message that states, "Your organization's admin manages your privacy settings and has decided to disable optional connected experiences."

If you're using Office for Mac, open any Office application and select the app menu (such as Word, or Excel) > **Preferences** > **Privacy**. This action will open the Account Privacy settings dialog box where you can see your privacy options.

For more information, see [Account Privacy Settings](https://support.microsoft.com/office/3e7bc183-bf52-4fd0-8e6b-78978f7f121b).

## Your privacy settings

If your admin has given you the ability to use optional connected experiences in your Office apps included with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise on a Windows device, you can go to **File** > **Account** > **Account Privacy** and select **Manage Settings** to manage your settings at any time. When enabled, you will have the option to use the services described in this article when you want to use them. When disabled, they will not be accessible.

If you're using Office for Mac, open any Office application and select the app menu (such as Word, or Excel) > **Preferences** > **Privacy**. This action will open the Account Privacy settings dialog box where you can see your privacy options.

## Required service data

When you use any of the optional cloud-backed services described in this article, Microsoft may collect [required service data for Office](required-service-data.md) (such as usage data, error and performance data) about the performance of the experience when you used it. This required service data may contain "personal data" as defined by Article 4 of the European GDPR. All required service data Microsoft collects during the use of any Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise applications and services is pseudonymized as defined in ISO/IEC 19944:2017, (section 8.3.3) standard.
