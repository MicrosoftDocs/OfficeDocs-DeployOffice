# Essential services for Office

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of Office products covered by this privacy information, see [Privacy controls available for Office products](products-versions-privacy-controls.md).

Office consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively. While you can control many of the connected experiences that are available to you, or to your users if you're the admin in your organization, there are a set of services that are essential to how Office functions and therefore cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Office. Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other privacy-related policy settings that you have configured.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Required service data for Office](required-service-data.md)
- [Connected experiences in Office](connected-experiences.md)

## List of essential services for Office 

The following table provides a list of the essential services for Office and a description of each service.

| **Service**  | **Description**  |
| ------ | ---- |
| [Authentication](#authentication-events) | Authentication is a cross-platform service that validates your Office user identity.  It is required to enable you to sign in to Office, activate your Office license, access your files stored in the cloud, and provides a consistent experience across Office sessions and your devices.    |
| [Click-to-Run](#click-to-run-events) | Click-to-Run is the installation technology used to install and update Office on Windows. It checks for new versions of Office, and when a new version is available, downloads and installs it. Click-to-Run will detect the need for, perform the download of, and install Office updates, including security updates.     |
| [Enhanced Configuration Service (ECS)](#enhanced-configuration-service-ecs-events) | ECS provides Microsoft the ability to reconfigure Office installations without the need for you to redeploy Office. It is used to control the gradual rollout of features or updates, while the impact of the rollout is monitored from diagnostic data being collected. It is also used to mitigate security or performance issues with a feature or update. In addition, ECS supports configuration changes related to diagnostic data to help ensure that the appropriate events are being collected. |
| [Licensing](#licensing-events)     | Licensing is a cloud-based service that supports your Office activation for new installations and maintains the license on your devices after Office has been activated. It registers each of your devices and activates Office, checks the status of your Office subscription, and manages your product keys.    |
|[Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU)](#microsoft-autoupdate-mau-events)|Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) is the technology used to update Microsoft applications produced for macOS, such as Office. MAU will detect the need for, perform the download of, and install application updates, including security updates.|
|[OneNote sync](#onenote-sync-events)|OneNote for Mac only supports notebooks stored on the internet in OneDrive or SharePoint Online. OneNote for Mac continually syncs all of the user's notes with OneDrive or SharePoint Online. This lets users open, view, and edit their notebooks on all their devices so their notebooks are always up to date.
 [Services Configuration](#services-configuration-events)  | Services Configuration provides the ability to make updates to Office configuration settings to enable or disable client features. It is called every time an Office application is started and provides details about other Office configurations and services. Services Configuration also controls which services are designated as essential services.  |
| [Telemetry ](#telemetry-events)  | The Telemetry service is used to collect diagnostic data from Office applications. It enables the collection of the diagnostic data generated by Office, both required and optional diagnostic data. It is also responsible for the collection of some required service data for Office.  |

## Events and data fields for essential services for Office

The next sections provide the following information:

- A list of events for each essential service
- A description of each event
- A list of data fields in each event
- A description of each data field


## Authentication events

These diagnostic data events are collected when Office attempts to acquire an authentication token, either silently or through prompting.

### Office.Android.MSAGuestToAAD

This event helps in understanding how many users are getting prompted for providing personal account password, while accessing work resource, as their personal account could be a valid guest to work account's tenant.

This data helps us understand how many users are going through the pain of sign in re-prompts to prioritize AAD token acquisition silently based on a Microsoft account SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) assertion.

The following fields are collected:

- **Tag** - Indicates that user got sign-in prompt for personal account, while accessing work account resource.


### Office.Identity.FbaPromptWin32

Collected when Office shows the user a Forms-Based-Auth sign-in prompt.

Along with silent token acquisitions, authentication prompts are used to determine if user is in a broken authentication state which, for the user, results in what is essentially an Offline Client state, or in the worst case, broken authentication may prevent license acquisition and result in a completely unusable client.

Forms-Based-Auth (FBA) sign-in prompts are used for some on-premises authentication scenarios and typically we want to make sure this isn't happening, as everyone should be using Modern-Auth because of security vulnerabilities associated with FBA.

The following fields are collected:

  - **AuthScheme** - the authentication scheme used

  - **DocumentUrlHash** - an encrypted URL requesting

  - **EndTag** - the tag where FBA form is completed

  - **Flags** - Obsolete

  - **FlowTag** - the tag where FBA form is started

  - **LastError** – the error code returned

  - **PromptEndTime** - the time when then prompt ended

  - **PromptStartTime** - the time when the prompt started

  - **Result** - whether the authentication succeeded

  - **SessionEndTime** – the time when the event session ended

  - **Timeout** - the time when the prompt timed out

### Office.Identity.SignOutEvent

Collected when a user signs out of Office.

Knowing the user is signed out makes it possible to classify other events, such as prompts, as expected, so those events can be correctly computed in reliability / ship-readiness metrics and avoid alerting or rolling back builds on the faulty premise that the user is experiencing unexpected sign-in prompts.

The following fields are collected:

  - **FlowEndTime** - the time when the sign out action ended

  - **FlowStartTime** - the time when the sign out action started

  - **IdentityErrorState** - any identity error state during sign out

  - **IdentityHashedUniqueId** - the encrypted identity ID being signed out

  - **IdentityProviderType** - the identity provider of the identity being signed out

  - **IdentityUniqueID** - the identity ID being signed out

  - **SessionEndTime** - the time when the event session ended

  - **SignOutUserAction** - Indicates the user initiates the sign out action

### Office.Identity.SspiPromptWin32

Collected when Office shows the user a Windows SSPI sign-in prompt. Along with silent token acquisitions, authentication prompts determine whether a user is in a broken authentication state, which results in an Offline Client state. Broken authentication may prevent license acquisition and result in a completely unusable client.

Windows SSPI prompts are used for authenticating with Exchange (for mail synchronizing) when the user's Exchange resource hasn't been set up for multi-factor authentication.

These events, along with the Office.MATS namespace events, are used for the following purposes:

1\) Identify whether clients can successfully obtain an authentication token or have entered a broken authentication state.

2\) Evaluate whether changes that have occurred on the client or services have resulted in critical regressions in the user's authentication experience and reliability

3\) When failures occur, these signals emit important failure codes from the responsible component (Office client code, authentication libraries, or authority services) which can be used for triage, diagnosis and mitigation

4\) These signals power various ship readiness and health monitors, which fire alerts so our engineers can engage quickly and reduce the time to mitigation of critical user-blocking failures

The following fields are collected:

  - **AllowSavedCreds** - whether the new credential is persisted

  - **AuthScheme** - the authentication scheme used

  - **CredsSaved** - whether the new credential is saved

  - **DocumentUrlHash** - the encrypted URL requesting

  - **EndTag** - the tag where the prompt ended

  - **NewIdentity**\_ErrorState – whether the new identity is valid

  - **NewIdentity\_HashedUniqueId** - the encrypted new identity ID after prompt is completed

  - **NewIdentity\_ProviderType** - the new identity provider after the prompt is completed

  - **NewIdentity\_UniqueID** - the new identity ID after the prompt is completed

  - **OutStatus** - whether the prompt output is valid

  - **PromptEndTime** - the time when the prompt ended

  - **PromptFailedTag** - the tag that indicates SSPI prompt failure

  - **PromptFlow** - the tag that invoked the SSPI prompt

  - **PromptStartTime** - the time when the prompt started

  - **Proxy** - if proxy is used

  - **ServerHash** - the encrypted server address

  - **SessionEndTime** - the time when the event session ended

  - **Timeout** - the time when the prompt is timed out

  - **UiMessage** - the UI message in the prompt

  - **UserNameHash** - the encrypted user name

### Office.Identity.Win32Prompt

Collected when Office shows the user a multi-factor authentication sign-in prompt. Along with silent token acquisitions, authentication prompts determine whether a user is in a broken authentication state, which results in an Offline Client state. Broken authentication may prevent license acquisition and result in a completely unusable client.

These events, along with the Office.MATS namespace events, are used for the following purposes:

1\) Identify whether clients can successfully obtain an authentication token or have entered in to a broken authentication state.

2\) Evaluate whether changes that have occurred on the client or services have resulted in critical regressions in the user's authentication experience and reliability

3\) When failures occur, these signals emit important failure codes from the responsible component (Office client code, authentication libraries, or authority services) which can be used for triage, diagnosis and mitigation

4\) These signals power various ship readiness and health monitors, which fire alerts so our engineers can engage quickly and reduce the time to mitigation of critical user-blocking failures.

The following fields are collected:

  - **AdalWAMUsed** – the tag that indicates result if ADAL-atop-WAM is used

  - **CallTag** – the tag that indicates the caller of sign in UI

  - **Context** - the sign in context for the prompt

  - **EndTagIdentityProviderRequested** - the tag where the identity provider is requested

  - **HrdShownTag** - the tag where the HRD sign in dialog is shown

  - **IdentityProviderResulted** - the identity provider type it is requesting

  - **IdPFlowTag** - the tag that indicates the identity request result

  - **LastLoginDelta** - the time delta from last successful login

  - **NewIdentity\_ErrorState** - whether the identity is valid after prompt

  - **NewIdentity\_ProviderType** - the new identity provider type after prompt

  - **NewIdentity\_UniqueID** - the new identity ID returned after prompt

  - **PromptCorrelation** - the prompt correlation ID for diagnostic purpose

  - **PromptEndTime** - the time when the prompt ended

  - **PromptStartTime** – the time when the prompt started

  - **SessionEndTime** - the time when the event session ended

  - **ShowUIResult** – the result code returned from the prompt UI

  - **StartTag** – the tag where Win32 prompt started

  - **Timeout** - the time when the prompt is timed out

  - **WasIdentitySignedOut** - whether the user is signed out

### Office.MATS.OneAuth.ActionMicrosoftOfficeWin32

Microsoft Auth Telemetry System (MATS) is collected when Office attempts to acquire an authentication token, either silently or through prompting. When acquisition attempts fail, error information is included. These events help our users avoid entering broken authentication states by:

- Identifying whether clients can successfully obtain an authentication token from the service, or have entered a broken authentication state.

- Evaluate when changes occur on the client or services, whether they result in critical regressions in the user's authentication experience and reliability

- When failures occur, these signals emit important failure codes from the responsible component (Office client code, authentication libraries, or authority services) which can be used for triage, diagnosis and mitigation

- These signals power various ship readiness and health monitors, which fire alerts so our engineers can engage quickly and reduce the time to mitigation of critical failures.

It is critical for detecting if a user is in a good state on the modern licensing stack, used for system health and used for diagnostic purposes if a user reports an issue with their machine

The following fields are collected:

  - **UserAction** – Identifier for the action taken by the user when presented with the dialog.

### Office.Licensing.SkuToSkuConversion

As part of licensing the user, if we have to change the user's SKU from one SKU to another, we send this signal out along with the success or failure code.

### Office.Licensing.TelemetryFlow.SearchForBindingResult

OEMs sell machines that come with Office (one-year subscriptions or perpetual).  These Office products are paid for when the customer purchases their machine. Machines that are set up with a specific regkey (OOBEMode: OEMTA) might have an Office binding associated with it.  When we boot Office on such machines, we perform service checks to see if an Office binding corresponding to the machine is found.

This telemetry activity tracks the success and failure points in searching for a binding so that we can ensure that machines that do have a binding can successfully fetch them, and that our services are healthy.  This activity does not track machines that turn out to not have any bindings associated with them after we check with our services.

### Office.Licensing.TelemetryFlow.ShowAFODialogs

After successfully obtaining a valid Office pin bound to a machine pre-bundled with Office, we show the user either a sign-in dialog or a redemption dialog.  Once the pin is redeemed, we show the EULA dialog.  As a part of our modernizing Activation for Office feature, we refreshed the two dialogs to convey more information regarding the Office product that comes with the machine.

### OneNote.Storage.ConnectivityChanged

The event logs if a user has internet connectivity or not. This is used to correlate the other sync health performance metrics by allowing us to ignore events that occur while a user does not have internet connectivity as we do not expect our service latency to be acceptable without internet connectivity. This allows us to calculate an accurate session count for our metrics across slices of customers (per-tenant, per-sector). We also use it to filter error reports as there are numerous sync errors that we expect to occur without network connectivity but that warrant investigation otherwise.

If we do not receive this data, we will not be able to accurately monitor our products performance or determine if errors experienced by a user are expected or require further investigation.

The following fields are collected:

- **InternetConnectivityNowAvailable** -  If the connectivity state has been changed so it is now Internet

### OneNote.Storage.LegacyInboundLatency

This signal is only collected for the worst performing download in the last 300 seconds (the number of seconds is configurable by Microsoft depending on service performance and condition).

This is used to ensure service health by allowing us to see which tenants are experiencing an unacceptably slow inbound of data to our service, information about the data they are uploading when they experienced the slow inbound and how widespread within a tenant that latency issue is. It is also used to report service health and performance across our customers to measure trends over time and alert on issues automatically for engineering mitigation. If we do not have this data it will prevent us from ensuring adequate download performance when a user syncs changes from SharePoint to their computer.

The following fields are collected: 

- **IsEducationNotebook** - A bool indicating if the notebook is an education notebook

- **NotebookId** - The ID of the notebook that this upload is part of

- **TimeToConfirmSyncedWithServerInMs** - The time in milliseconds it took to perform the upload

### OneNote.Storage.LegacyOutboundLatency

This signal is only collected for the worst performing download in the last 300 seconds (the number of seconds is configurable by Microsoft depending on service performance and condition).

This is used to ensure service health by allowing us to see which tenants are experiencing an unacceptably slow outbound of data to our service, information about the data they were uploading when they experienced the slow outbound and how widespread within a tenant that latency issue is. It is also used to report service health and performance across our customers to measure trends over time and alert on issues automatically for engineering mitigation. If we do not have this data, it will prevent us from ensuring adequate performance when syncing users changes up to SharePoint. 

The following fields are collected:

- **NotebookId** - The ID of the notebook that this upload is part of

- **TimeToConfirmSyncedWithServerInMs** - The time in milliseconds it took to perform the upload

### OneNote.Storage.RealTime.FileDataObjectDownload 

The critical signal used to track performance when a user inbounds a file data object (i.e. an embedded file or image) which is downloaded directly from our service and not as part of a sync operation on a page, section or notebook. This signal is only collected for the worst performing download in the last 300 seconds (the number of seconds is configurable by Microsoft depending on service performance and condition).

This is used to ensure service health and performance by allowing us to see which tenants are experiencing an unacceptably slow download of data from our service, and how widespread within a tenant that latency issue is, and report our behavior over time allowing us to measure service performance trends. If we see an unacceptable latency for a file object, we will also use this data to correlate that with other signals from the client and service regarding the object to make improvements to our download process. We also split the data based on the extension of the file object downloaded as we have different expectations based on whether the file is presented inline in our canvas (e.g. an image) or is a non-inline file (such as a text document). If we do not receive this data, it will prevent us from monitoring the performance of these downloads

The following fields are collected: 

- **FileSizeInBytes** - The size of the file being downloaded in bytes 

- **IsImage** - A bool determining if the file being downloaded has an extension that matches a pre-determined list of common image formats (.bmp, .emf, .gif, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .png) that we display inline in the canvas

- **TimeToDownload** - The length of time it took to successfully download the FDO from our blob storage to the device 

### OneNote.Storage.RealTime.WebSocketDownload

This is used to ensure service health by allowing us to see which tenants are experiencing an unacceptably slow inbound of data from our service, information about the data they were downloading when they experienced the slow inbound and how widespread within a tenant that latency issue is. It is also used to report service health and performance across our customers to measure trends over time and alert on issues automatically for engineering mitigation. 

If we see an unacceptable latency for a section or notebook we will also use this data to correlate that with other signals from the client and service regarding the same document to identify client-side performance regressions allowing us to deliver a more performant service.

If we do not receive this data, we will be unable to monitor the performance of this aspect of our service, or the impact of server side changes we may find necessary due to usage or other factors.

It is also used to report service health and performance across our customers to measure trends over time and alert on issues automatically for engineering mitigation. We will also use this data to track the impact and effectiveness of improvements we make to our clients and services. 

If we see an unacceptable latency for a section or notebook we will also use this data to correlate that with other signals from the client and service regarding the same document to identify performance regressions allowing us to deliver a more performant experience.

If we do not receive this data, we will be unable to monitor the performance of this aspect of our service, or the impact of server side changes we may find necessary due to usage or other factors.

### OneNote.Storage.SyncHealth

The critical signal used to track errors and exceptions that have occurred inside the sync stack in the OneNote client allowing us to monitor and mitigate these unexpected conditions.

This is used to ensure service health by allowing us to see error reports from the clients in near real time, which lets us respond to sync issues as they arise. It is also used to identify how widespread an issue is, and how severe by cross-referencing the error tag with the client code to identify the source of failure. We also aggregate this data to get information on our performance over time and the impact and effectiveness of improvements we make to our clients and services. If we do not have this data, we won’t be able to proactively respond to error conditions in our sync service without customer escalation.

The following fields are collected: 

- **Service** - The sync service the client was using when the error occurred (Legacy or Modern Sync)
