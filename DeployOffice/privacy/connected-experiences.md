# Connected experiences in Office

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of Office products covered by this privacy information, see [Privacy controls available for Office products](products-versions-privacy-controls.md).

Office consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively. Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences.

## Connected experiences that analyze your content

Connected experiences that analyze your content are experiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Translator.

The following table provides a list of connected experiences that analyze your content and also provides links to more information about them.

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>[1]</sup> When users are signed in with a work or school account, these connected experiences are optional connected experiences and are provided under the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement), and other terms may also apply. For more information, see [Overview of optional connected experiences in Office](optional-connected-experiences.md). If you're an admin, these optional connected experiences can be managed by privacy controls for connected experiences or by the *Allow the use of additional optional connected experiences in Office* policy setting.
>
> <sup>[2]</sup> These connected experiences won’t be available to your users in the following scenarios on Windows devices running Version 2406 or later in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook of Microsoft 365 Apps:
> - If your organization is using the PowerShell advanced setting *BlockContentAnalysisServices* with sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection. For more information, see [Prevent some connected experiences that analyze content](/purview/sensitivity-labels-office-apps#prevent-some-connected-experiences-that-analyze-content).
> - If your organization is using Double Key Encryption (DKE) to protect files and emails.
>
> <sup>[3]</sup> Starting with Version 2406 of Microsoft 365 Apps, these connected experiences are no longer managed by privacy controls for connected experiences. Instead, these connected experiences can be managed by using existing security controls available in Microsoft Purview portals.

That same basic functionality also remains available if you decide to disable the use of connected experiences that analyze your content. In both cases, no content or data related to your use of Editor is sent to Microsoft.

> <sup>[5]</sup> For devices running Android, these ink capabilities remain available even if you're not connected to the internet. These ink capabilities also remain available on devices running Android even if you decide to disable the use of connected experiences that analyze your content. In both cases, no data about the use of these ink capabilities is sent to Microsoft.

For example, if you're using text predictions in Outlook on a Windows device or in Word on a Mac device. In those scenarios, no content or data related to your use of text predictions is sent to Microsoft.

## Connected experiences that download online content

Connected experiences that download online content are experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. For example, Office templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.

For more information, see [Overview of optional connected experiences in Office](optional-connected-experiences.md). If you're an admin, these optional connected experiences can be managed by privacy controls for connected experiences or by the *Allow the use of additional optional connected experiences in Office* policy setting.
>
> <sup>[11]</sup> Starting with Version 2405 of Microsoft 365 Apps, these connected experiences are no longer managed by privacy controls for connected experiences. Instead, these connected experiences can be managed by using existing security controls available in Microsoft Purview portals. For more information, see [Set up Information Rights Management (IRM) in SharePoint admin center](/purview/set-up-irm-in-sp-admin-center) and [Manage sensitivity labels in Office apps](/purview/sensitivity-labels-office-apps).

## Choose whether these connected experiences are available to use

You can choose whether certain types of connected experiences, such as connected experiences that download online content, are available to use. How you make that choice depends on whether you're signed into Office with a Microsoft account, such as a personal outlook.com email address, or with a work or school account.

If you're signed in with a Microsoft account, open an Office app, such as Word, and go to **File** > **Account** > **Account Privacy** > **Manage Settings**. Under the **Connected experiences** section, you can choose whether certain types of connected experiences, such as experiences that analyze your content, are available to use. If you don't go to **Manage Settings**, all connected experiences are available to you.

If you're signed in with a work or school account, the admin in your organization decides whether these connected experiences are available to you. You don't see any choices for these connected experiences when you go to **File** > **Account** > **Account Privacy** > **Manage Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you're using Office for Mac, open any Office application and select the app menu (such as Word, or Excel) > **Preferences** > **Privacy**. This will open the Account Privacy settings dialog box where you can see your privacy options.
> - For more information, see [Account Privacy Settings](https://support.microsoft.com/office/3e7bc183-bf52-4fd0-8e6b-78978f7f121b).

If you're the admin for your organization, you can use policy settings to determine whether these connected experiences are available to your users. If you don't use these policy settings, all connected experiences are available for your users. For more information about using these policy settings, see the following articles: 

- [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](manage-privacy-controls.md)
- [Use preferences to manage privacy controls for Office for Mac](mac-privacy-preferences.md).
- [Use preferences to manage privacy controls for Office on iOS devices](ios-privacy-preferences.md)

If you choose to turn off some types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences is grayed out, or you get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.

Even if you decide to turn off these connected experiences, certain Office functionality remains available, such as synching a mailbox in Outlook, and Teams and Skype for Business continues to work. Also, there's a set of services that are essential to how Office functions that can't be turned off, such as the licensing service that confirms that you're properly licensed to use Office.
