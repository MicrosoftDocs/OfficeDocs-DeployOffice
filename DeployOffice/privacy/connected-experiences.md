# Connected experiences in Office

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article applies to Version 1904 or later of the following Office client software installed on a computer running Windows:
> - Office 365 ProPlus and Office 365 Business
> - Office 365 Personal, Office 365 Home, or other versions of Office that are part of an Office 365 subscription.
> - Project and Visio that come with some subscription plans, such as the Project Online Professional plan or Visio Online Plan 2.

> The information also applies to Version 16.28 or later of the following Office for Mac applications: Excel, Outlook, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Word.

Office consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively. Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences.

## Connected experiences that analyze your content

Connected experiences that analyze your content are experiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.

The following table provides a list of connected experiences that analyze your content and also provides links to more information about them.

## Choose whether these connected experiences are available to use

You can choose whether certain types of connected experiences, such as connected experiences that download online content, are available to use. How you make that choice depends on whether you are signed into Office with a Microsoft account, such as a personal outlook.com email address, or with a work or school account.

If you are signed in with a Microsoft account, open an Office app, such as Word, and go to **File** > **Account** > **Account Privacy** > **Manage Settings**. Under the **Connected experiences** section, you can choose whether certain types of connected experiences, such as experiences that analyze your content, are available to use. If you don't go to **Manage Settings**, all connected experiences will be available to you.

If you are signed in with a work or school account, the admin in your organization will decide whether these connected experiences are available to you. You won’t see any choices for these connected experiences if you go to **File** > **Account** > **Account Privacy** > **Manage Settings**.

If you are the admin for your organization, you can use policy settings to determine whether these connected experiences are available to your users. If you don’t use these policy settings, all connected experiences will be available for your users. For more information about using these policy settings, see [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Office 365 ProPlus](manage-privacy-controls.md).

If you choose to turn off some types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.

Even if you decide to turn off these connected experiences, certain Office functionality will remain available, such as synching a mailbox in Outlook, and Teams and Skype for Business will continue to work. Also, there are a set of services that are essential to how Office functions that can’t be turned off, such as the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Office.
