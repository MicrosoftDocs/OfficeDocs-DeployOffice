# Required diagnostic data for Office

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of Office products covered by this privacy information, see [Privacy controls available for Office products](products-versions-privacy-controls.md).

Diagnostic data is used to keep Office secure and up-to-date, detect, diagnose and fix problems, and also make product improvements. This data doesn't include a user's name or email address, the content of the user's files, or information about apps unrelated to Office.

This diagnostic data is collected and sent to Microsoft about Office client software running on the user's device. Some diagnostic data is required, while some diagnostic data is optional. We give you the ability to choose whether to send us required or optional diagnostic data through the use of privacy controls, such as policy settings for organizations. You can see the diagnostic data being sent to us by using the Diagnostic Data Viewer.

***Required diagnostic data*** is the minimum data necessary to help keep Office secure, up-to-date, and performing as expected on the device it's installed on.

Required diagnostic data helps to identify problems with Office that may be related to a device or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if an Office feature crashes more frequently on a particular operating system version, with newly introduced features, or when certain Office features are disabled. Required diagnostic data helps us detect, diagnose, and fix these problems more quickly so the impact to users or organizations is reduced.

For more information about diagnostic data, see the following articles:

- [Optional diagnostic data for Office](optional-diagnostic-data.md)
- [Using the Diagnostic Data Viewer with Office](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cf761ce9-d805-4c60-a339-4e07f3182855)
