# Tools to manage volume activation of Office

***Applies to:*** *Volume licensed versions of Office LTSC 2021, Office 2019, and Office 2016 (including Project and Visio)*

The Office Software Protection Platform script (ospp.vbs), the Software License Manager script (slmgr.vbs), and the Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT) can help you configure and test volume licensed versions of Office, including Project and Visio. Before you read this article, we recommend that you read the following articles:
- [Overview of volume activation of Office](plan-volume-activation-of-office.md)
- [Activate volume licensed versions of Office by using MAK](activate-office-by-using-mak.md)
- [Activate volume licensed versions of Office by using Active Directory](activate-office-by-using-active-directory.md).
  
## The ospp.vbs script

The Office Software Protection Platform script (ospp.vbs) enables you to configure volume licensed versions of Office products, including Project and Visio. The ospp.vbs script is located in the Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16 folder. If you installed the 32-bit version of Office on a 64-bit operating system, go to the Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16 folder.
  
Running ospp.vbs requires the cscript.exe script engine. To see the Help file, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console  
 cscript ospp.vbs /?
```
  
The general syntax is as follows:
  
```console
cscript ospp.vbs [Option:Value] [ComputerName] [User] [Password]
```
  
 ***Option*** Specifies the option and value to use to activate a product, install or uninstall a product key, install and display license information, set KMS host name and port, and remove KMS host name and port. The options and values are listed in the tables in this section.
  
 ***ComputerName*** Name of the remote computer. If a computer name isn't provided, the local computer is used.
  
 ***User*** Account that has the required permission on the remote computer.
  
 ***Password*** Password for the account. If a user account and password aren't provided, the current credentials are used.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you run the ospp.vbs, ensure that:
> - If you want to run the script on a remote computer, the Windows firewall allows Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) traffic on the remote computer. 
> - The user account you will use is a member of the Administrators group on the computer on which you run the script.
> - You run ospp.vbs script from an elevated command prompt.

| /ckms-domain  |*(Windows 8.1 and later versions only)* Clears the specific DNS domain in which all KMS SRV records can be found. The specific KMS host is used if it's set by the /sethst option. Otherwise, auto-discovery of the KMS host is used.   |

### Scenarios that use ospp.vbs

The following scenarios assume that you're running ospp.vbs in an elevated command prompt.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Any changes that you make affect only the Office client products. You have to configure the Windows client separately by using the [slmgr.vbs script](#the-slmgrvbs-script).
  
#### To change the product key to a MAK key on a remote computer

1. If the remote computer is named contoso1, run the following command to enter the product key. This assumes that you have administrator credentials on the remote computer. If your credentials on the remote computer differ from your logon name and password, you must type your logon name and password at the command line, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /inpkey:xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx contoso1
```

2. To activate the remote computer, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /act contoso1
```

#### To diagnose KMS activation errors

1. If the computer has the KMS client key installed, check the licensing status. To do this, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /dstatusall
```

2. To check the KMS activation history, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /dhistorykms
```

3. To trigger activation, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /act
```

4. Check the error message for error code 0xC004F042. If in the notification dialog boxes you see an error code that is shown to users, you can also use that code to check the error message. To do this, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /ddescr:0xC004F042
```

#### To turn on or off KMS host caching on the KMS client

1. On the KMS client computer, to turn caching on, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /cachst:TRUE
```

2. On the KMS client computer, to turn caching off, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /cachst:FALSE
```

#### To test KMS host name, and then set to auto-discovery

1. If you're testing a KMS host named kmstest.contoso.com, and you want to specify it in the KMS client, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:kmstest.contoso.com
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the default port on the KMS host computer, you must run ospp.vbs with the /setprt option. For example: cscript ospp.vbs /setprt:1750
  
2. To trigger activation, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /act
```

3. To check the KMS activation history to see whether the host was successfully contacted, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /dhistorykms
```

4. Now you want this KMS client to use Domain Name System (DNS) for auto-discovery of the production KMS host. To remove the KMS host name, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
cscript ospp.vbs /remhst
```

## The slmgr.vbs script

The Software License Manager (slmgr.vbs) script, located in the Windows\system32 folder, is used to configure and retrieve volume activation information for the Office KMS host and the Windows host. For more information, see [Configuring KMS Hosts](/previous-versions/tn-archive/ff793407(v=technet.10)) for Windows.
  
You can run the script locally on the target computer or remotely from another computer. You have to be an administrator to use the script. If a standard user runs slmgr.vbs, some license data might be missing or incorrect, and many operations are prohibited.
  
The slmgr.vbs script can use the Windows-based script host, wscript.exe, or the command-based script host, cscript.exe, and administrators can specify which script engine to use. If no script engine is specified, slmgr.vbs runs by using the default script engine, wscript.exe. We recommend the cscript.exe script engine.
  
You must restart the Software Licensing Service for any changes to take effect. To restart the Software Licensing Service, use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Services snap-in or run the following command:

```console  
net stop sppsvc && net start sppsvc
```
  
The slmgr.vbs script requires at least one parameter. If you run the script without any parameters, it displays Help information. The following table lists slmgr.vbs command-line options, and a description of each. Most of the parameters in the table configure the KMS host computer. However, the parameters /sai and /sri are passed to KMS clients after the KMS clients contact the KMS host computer. The general syntax of slmgr.vbs is as follows (assuming you're using the cscript.exe as the script engine):
  
```console  
 cscript slmgr.vbs [ComputerName] [User] [Password] [Option]
```
  
 ***ComputerName*** Name of the remote computer. If you don't provide a computer name, the local computer is used.
  
 ***User*** Account with required permission on the remote computer.
  
 ***Password*** Password for the account. If you don't provide a user account and password, current credentials are used.
  
 ***Option*** Options are shown in the following table.
  
### Slmgr.vbs command options
