# Windows Server end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Microsoft 365 Apps isn't supported on Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2.
> - Using Microsoft 365 Apps on older, unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. These issues could include new features added to Microsoft 365 Apps, or updates to existing features, not working as expected.
> - If your organization is using a version of Windows Server that doesn't support Microsoft 365 Apps, we recommend that you move to [Windows 365](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365) or [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop/).

Microsoft 365 (and Office 365) is governed by the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern), which requires customers to stay current as per the servicing and [system requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources) for the product or service. This policy includes using Microsoft 365 Apps on a Windows operating system that is currently in support.

The following sections provide information about support for Microsoft 365 Apps on various versions of Windows Server.

## Windows Server 2008 R2

> [!NOTE]
> Security updates for Version 2002 of Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows Server 2008 R2 will end after January 10, 2023.

Windows Server 2008 R2 went out of support on January 14, 2020. Running Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows Server 2008 R2 is no longer supported, even if you have [ESU for Windows Server 2008 R2](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/extended-security-updates).

Version 2002 is the last version of Microsoft 365 Apps that you can install on devices running Windows Server 2008 R2. If you try to install a newer version of Microsoft 365 Apps, such as Version 2005, on a device running Windows Server 2008 R2, you'll receive an error message.

Even though Windows Server 2008 R2 is no longer supported, we've decided to continue to provide you with security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps for the next three years, until January 2023. But, during that time, as long as the device is still running Windows Server 2008 R2, your installation of Microsoft 365 Apps won't receive any new features updates.

For information about managing updates to Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Windows 7 end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps](windows-7-support.md). The same information about managing updates, and using Configuration Manager, for Windows 7 also applies to Windows Server 2008 R2.
