# Windows Server end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Microsoft 365 Apps on older, unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. These issues could include new features added to Microsoft 365 Apps, or updates to existing features, not working as expected.

Microsoft 365 is governed by the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern), which requires customers to stay current as per the servicing and [system requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources) for the product or service. This policy includes using Microsoft 365 Apps on a Windows operating system that is currently in support.

If your organization is using a version of Windows Server that doesn't support Microsoft 365 Apps, we recommend that you move to [Windows 365](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365) or [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop/).
