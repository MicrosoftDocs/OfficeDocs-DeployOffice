# Windows 8.1 end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Support for Windows 8.1 ends on January 10, 2023.
> - Microsoft 365 Apps won't be supported on Windows 8.1 after January 10, 2023.
> - If you're running Office on Windows 8.1 in your organization, you should [move to a more current operating system](#move-from-windows-81-to-a-more-current-operating-system).
> - If you're a home user running Office on Windows 8.1, see [Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 end of support and Office](https://support.microsoft.com/office/34e28be4-1e4f-4928-b210-3f45d8215595) instead of reading this article.

Microsoft 365 is governed by the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern), which requires customers to stay current as per the servicing and [system requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources) for the product or service. This policy includes using Microsoft 365 Apps on a Windows operating system that is currently in support.

Using Microsoft 365 Apps on older and unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. Therefore, if your organization is using Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 8.1, we strongly recommend your organization moves those devices to a more current and supported operating system, such as Windows 11 (or Windows 10).

## What happens to Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 8.1 after January 10, 2023

Support for Windows 8.1 ends on January 10, 2023. After that date, Microsoft 365 Apps won't be supported on a device running Windows 8.1.

In addition to not being supported, the following restrictions will apply to Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 8.1.

- You won't receive any new feature, security, or other quality updates for Microsoft 365 Apps.
- You won't be able to do a new installation of Microsoft 365 Apps.
- You won't be able to perform an Online Repair of Microsoft 365 Apps.

The above applies to all supported versions of Microsoft 365 Apps and for all update channels, such as Current Channel or Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel.

## Move from Windows 8.1 to a more current operating system

To continue to get security updates for Windows and updates to Microsoft 365 Apps, we strongly recommend that you move to a more current and supported operating system before January 10, 2023. For example, move to Windows 11 (or Windows 10).

> [!TIP]
> If youâ€™re using Microsoft Configuration Manager (current branch), you can use the [Computers with a specific operating system](/mem/configmgr/core/servers/manage/list-of-reports#operating-system) report to identify devices that are running Windows 8.1.

For more information about Windows 11, see the following articles:
- [Windows 11 overview](/windows/whats-new/windows-11-overview)
- [Plan for Windows 11](/windows/whats-new/windows-11-plan)
- [Prepare for Windows 11](/windows/whats-new/windows-11-prepare)

Other Microsoft resources are available to help you make the transition to using Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 11, including [FastTrack](/fasttrack/products-and-capabilities#windows-11) and [App Assure](/fasttrack/products-and-capabilities#app-assure).
