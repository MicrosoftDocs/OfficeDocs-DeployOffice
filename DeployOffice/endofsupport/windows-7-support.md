# Windows 7 end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020. [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962)
> - Microsoft 365 Apps is no longer supported on Windows 7.
> - If you're a home user running Microsoft 365 or Office on Windows 7, [read this article](https://support.microsoft.com/office/34e28be4-1e4f-4928-b210-3f45d8215595) instead of reading the following article.

Microsoft 365 is governed by the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern), which requires customers to stay current as per the servicing and [system requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources) for the product or service. These requirements include using Microsoft 365 Apps on a Windows operating system that is currently in support.

Using Microsoft 365 Apps on older, unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. Therefore, if your organization is using Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 7, we strongly recommend your organization moves those devices to Windows 11 or Windows 10.

## Security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 7

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Security updates Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 7 ended on January 10, 2023.

Even though Windows 7 is no longer supported, we decided to provide you with security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps for three years, until January 2023. We did this to give you more time to make the transition from using Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 7 to devices running a supported operating system, such as Windows 11 or Windows 10. But as long as the device is still running Windows 7, your installation of Microsoft 365 Apps won't receive any new feature updates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Even with these security updates, Microsoft 365 Apps is no longer supported on Windows 7.
> - This information applies even if you purchased [Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows 7](/troubleshoot/windows-client/windows-7-eos-faq/windows-7-extended-security-updates-faq). ESU for Windows 7 ended on January 10, 2023.

## How to manage Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 7

Version 2002 is the last version of Microsoft 365 Apps that's available for devices running Windows 7.

This means that if you want to use Microsoft 365 Apps on devices that are running Windows 7, you need to use Version 2002. If you try to install a newer version of Microsoft 365 Apps, such as Version 2201, on a device running Windows 7, you'll receive an error message.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - As of January 2022, attempting to do a new installation of Version 2002 will fail.
> - Performing an Online Repair of an existing installation of Version 2002 will also fail.
> - Updating an existing installation of Version 2002 will work until January 10, 2023, after which no more updates will be available.

To update an existing installation of Version 2002, you can keep using the same management tools that you're currently using, such as the Office Deployment Tool or Configuration Manager. Also, Microsoft 365 Apps can remain on the same update channel as before.

If Microsoft 365 Apps is configured to get updates directly from the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN) on the internet, Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 7 will be updated automatically to the most current release of Version 2002 for that update channel.

## Guidance when using Configuration Manager for updates

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 7 ended on January 10, 2023.

If you use Configuration Manager and the Software Update management workflow to update installations of Microsoft 365 Apps, we recommend that you create a separate collection for your Windows 7 devices. Then, use a query rule to add members to the collection.

On the second Tuesday of each month, a new update package for Version 2002 that is only for devices running Windows 7 will be made available in the Microsoft Update Catalog. There will be an update package for each architecture (x86 or x64). That update package can be used with whichever update channel of Microsoft 365 Apps you've deployed. There won't be separate update packages of Version 2002 for each update channel. For example, the same update package can be used to update a Current Channel or a Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel installation of Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 7.

In the Office 365 Updates node, you'll see entries like the following, where ##### will be replaced by the most current build number:

- Microsoft 365 Apps Update for Windows 7 – Version 2002 for x64 based Edition (Build 12527.#####)
- Microsoft 365 Apps Update for Windows 7 – Version 2002 for x86 based Edition (Build 12527.#####)

These update packages are configured to apply ***only*** to devices running Windows 7. These update packages can't be used to update Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running other supported operating systems, such as Windows 11 or Windows 10.

If you use an automatic deployment rule (ADR), you should create a new rule for these update packages. Then, use the new rule for your collection that contains your Windows 7 devices. We recommend using the "Title" property and searching for "Microsoft 365 Apps Update for Windows 7" and the architecture you support. If you support both x86 and x64, you can include both updates in one Software Update Package as clients will apply the appropriate update. You should also check other existing ADRs to make sure they don't incorrectly try to apply these update packages, which are only for devices running Windows 7, to devices running other operating systems.

## After moving Microsoft 365 Apps to a supported Windows operating system

After you move Microsoft 365 Apps to a supported Windows operating system, you can configure Microsoft 365 Apps to begin receiving newer versions and feature updates again. Since updates for Microsoft 365 Apps are cumulative, you'll receive all the feature updates that you missed while your device was running Windows 7.

If you're getting updates directly from the Office CDN on the internet, after the device is moved to a supported operating system, Microsoft 365 Apps will be updated automatically to the most current version available for that update channel and will start receiving new features again.

## What about other versions of Office on Windows 7?

Non-subscription versions of Office used by organizations, such as Office Professional Plus 2016 or Office Standard 2013, will continue to be supported based on the [Fixed Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/fixed). To see specific end of support dates for non-subscription versions of Office, go to [Search Product and Services Lifecycle Information](/lifecycle/products/).

Even if your version of Office is still supported, Windows 7 no longer receives security updates, leaving it vulnerable to security threats. We recommend that you move to a [supported operating system](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources), such as Windows 11 or Windows 10.
