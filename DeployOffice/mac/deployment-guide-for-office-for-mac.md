# Deployment guide for Office for Mac

This guide is intended to help administrators and other IT professionals to plan, implement, and maintain deployments of Office on devices running macOS in their organization.

For example, the Microsoft 365 Business Premium plan or the Office 365 E5 plan. This version is updated regularly to provide new features. It also receives security and quality updates, as needed.

- **Office LTSC for Mac 2021**, which is available through a volume licensing agreement. This version receives security and quality updates, as needed.
