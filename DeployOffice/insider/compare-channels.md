# Compare Microsoft 365 Insider channels

The Microsoft 365 Insider program provides early access to Microsoft 365 Apps features through two channels:
- Beta Channel
- Current Channel (Preview)

These channels are available for both Windows and Mac devices.

You can have different users in your organization on different channels. For example, you might put IT admins and application developers on Beta Channel, and your support desk or training staff on Current Channel (Preview).

The following table compares the channels and provides scenarios for business use.
