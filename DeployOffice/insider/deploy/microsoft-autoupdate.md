# Let Mac users choose Microsoft 365 Insider for themselves by using Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU)

If you want your Mac users to choose a Microsoft 365 Insider channel for themselves, they can follow these steps on their Mac.

1. Open any app, such as Word, and then select **Check for Updates** on the **Help** menu.
2. In the **Microsoft AutoUpdate** dialog that appears, select **Advanced...**
3. Select either **Current Channel (Preview)** or **Beta Channel** for the update channel.

> [!NOTE]
> - Keep in mind that Beta Channel isn't supported.
> - By default, Microsoft AutoUpdate automatically checks for updates every 12 hours.
> - If you want to choose the Microsoft 365 Insider channel for your Mac users, you can [use a preference](preference.md).
> - Mac users can't choose a Microsoft 365 Insider channel if the installation comes from the Mac App Store. Current Channel is the only channel available for those installations.
