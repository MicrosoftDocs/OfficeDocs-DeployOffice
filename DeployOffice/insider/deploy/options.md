# Options for deploying Microsoft 365 Insider

The Microsoft 365 Insider program offers organizations an opportunity to evaluate new Microsoft 365 Apps features before general release.

Both of the following Microsoft 365 Insider deployment scenarios are supported:
 - [Change to Microsoft 365 Insider when Microsoft 365 Apps is already installed](#change-to-microsoft-365-insider-when-microsoft-365-apps-is-already-installed)
 - [Choose Microsoft 365 Insider when you install Microsoft 365 Apps](#choose-microsoft-365-insider-when-you-install-microsoft-365-apps)

As the admin, you can deploy Microsoft 365 Insider for your users. Or, you can allow users to select which Microsoft 365 Insider channel they want to use.

Different deployment options are available, for Windows and Mac devices. Which option, or options, you choose depends on how you manage Microsoft 365 Apps in your organization.
