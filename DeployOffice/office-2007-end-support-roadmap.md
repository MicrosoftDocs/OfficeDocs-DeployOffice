# Office 2007 end of support roadmap

Office 2007 reached its end of support on October 10, 2017. If you haven't already begun to upgrade your Office 2007 environment, we recommend you start now.
  
This article provides recommendations, information, and links to help administrators and IT Pros in large enterprises plan their upgrades to Office 365 ProPlus.
  
> [!NOTE]
> - If you're a home user who wants to upgrade from Office 2007 to the latest version of Office, see [How do I upgrade Office?](https://support.office.com/article/ee68f6cf-422f-464a-82ec-385f65391350)
> - If you're an admin at a small business or organization who wants to help your users upgrade to the latest version of Office, see [Upgrade your Office 365 for business users to the latest Office client](https://support.office.com/article/f6b00895-b5fd-4af6-a656-b7788ea20cbb). 
  
We also recommend business and enterprise customers use the deployment benefits provided by Microsoft and Microsoft Certified Partners, including [Microsoft FastTrack](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/office) for cloud migrations and [Software Assurance Planning Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-planning-services-overview.aspx) for on-premises upgrades. 
  
## What does end of support mean?

Office 2007, like almost all Microsoft products, had a support lifecycle during which we provided bug fixes and security fixes. This lifecycle lasts for a certain number of years from the date of the product's initial release. For Office 2007, the support lifecycle was 10 years. The end of this lifecycle is known as the product's end of support. Office 2007 reached its end of support on October 10, 2017, and Microsoft no longer provides the following:
  
- Technical support for issues
    
- Bug fixes for issues that are discovered
    
- Security fixes for vulnerabilities that are discovered
    
Because of the changes listed above, we strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible.
  
## What are my options?

Since Office 2007 has reached its end of support, you should explore your options and prepare an upgrade plan to either of these latest versions of Office:
  
- Office 365 ProPlus, the subscription version of Office that comes with most Office 365 enterprise plans.
    
- Office 2019, which is sold as a one-time purchase and available for one computer per license.
    
A key difference between Office 365 ProPlus and Office 2019 is that Office 365 ProPlus is updated on a regular basis, as often as monthly, with new features. Office 2019 only has the same features that it had when it was released in October 2018.
  
This article provides guidance on upgrading to Office 365 ProPlus.
  
## What is Office 365? What is Office 365 ProPlus?

Office 365 provides subscription plans that include access to Office applications and other cloud services, including Skype for Business, Exchange Online, and OneDrive for Business. Office 365 ProPlus is the version of Office that comes with most Office 365 enterprise plans. Office 365 ProPlus includes the full versions of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, Access, and Skype for Business installed on your client computers.
  
Unlike Office 2007, Office 365 ProPlus uses a user-based licensing model that allows people to install Office on up to 5 PCs or Macs and on their mobile devices. There are also differences in how you deploy, license, and activate Office 365 ProPlus compared to Office 2007. For more information about Office 365 ProPlus, see the following information:

## Review what's changed since Office 2007

To learn about some of the changes since Office 2007, review the following articles: [Changes in Office 2010](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/office-2010/cc178954%28v=office.14%29), [Changes in Office 2013](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/office-2013-resource-kit/cc178954%28v=office.15%29), and [Changes in Office 2016 for Windows](office2016/changes-in-office-2016-for-windows-desktop.md).
  
For information about the new features available in Office 365 ProPlus, see [What's new in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/95c8d81d-08ba-42c1-914f-bca4603e1426). For Office 2019, see [What's New in Office 2019](https://support.office.com/article/5077cbbe-0d94-44cc-b30e-654e37629b0c).
  
## Review the system requirements for Office 365 ProPlus

Before upgrading to Office 365 ProPlus, verify that your client computers meet or exceed the minimum [system requirements](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements).
  
In addition, you should review the system requirements for your Office server workloads. For more information, see [Exchange Server Supportability Matrix](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff728623%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx) and [System Requirements for Office server products](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements).
  
## Plan for Office 365

Because Office 365 ProPlus comes with most enterprise Office 365 plans, you should review your current Office 365 capabilities as part of planning an upgrade to Office 365 ProPlus. Prior to deploying Office 365 ProPlus, for example, you should ensure that all your users have Office 365 accounts and licenses. For more information, see [Deploy Office 365 Enterprise for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/ee73dafb-be54-492e-bcfd-0fbfb5f65e94).
  
## Assess application compatibility

Before deploying Office 365 ProPlus, you may want to test your business-critical VBA macros, third-party add-ins, and complex documents and spreadsheets to assess their compatibility with Office 365 ProPlus. For more information, see [Assess application compatibility](assess-office-365-proplus.md#step-4---assess-application-compatibility).
  
To help with assessing application compatibility with Office 365 ProPlus, we recommend using the Readiness Toolkit for Office add-ins and VBA. The Readiness Toolkit includes the Readiness Report Creator, which creates an Excel report with VBA macro compatibility and add-in readiness information to help your enterprise assess its readiness to move to Office 365 ProPlus. 
  
You can download the Readiness Toolkit for free from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=859119). For more information, see [Use the Readiness Toolkit to assess application compatibility for Office 365 ProPlus](use-the-readiness-toolkit-to-assess-application-compatibility-for-office-365-pro.md).
  
## Assess your infrastructure and environment

To decide how to upgrade to Office 365 ProPlus, you should evaluate your infrastructure and environment, including the following:
  
- Number and distribution of your clients, including required languages.
    
- IT infrastructure, including operating systems, mobile device support, user permissions and management, and software distribution methods.
    
- Network infrastructure, including connections to the Internet and internal software distribution points.
    
- Cloud infrastructure, including existing Office 365 capabilities, user licensing, and identity.
    
Your assessment of these components will influence how you want to upgrade. For more information, see [Assess your environment and requirements for deploying Office 365 ProPlus](assess-office-365-proplus.md).
  
## Review new Group Policy settings

As with any new version of Office, there are new Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) for Group Policy settings. All Group Policy settings for Office 365 ProPlus are now located in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0 and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0.
  
You can download the Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) for Group Policy settings for Office 365 ProPlus from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030) for free. The download includes an Excel file that lists all the Group Policy settings and the new policy settings for Office 365 ProPlus. 
  
## Choose how you want to deploy Office 365 ProPlus

You can deploy Office 365 ProPlus from the cloud, from a local source on your network, or with System Center Configuration Manager (or another software distribution solution). Which option you choose depends on your environment and business requirements. Deploying from the cloud, for example, minimizes your administrative overhead, but could require more network bandwidth. Deploying with Configuration Manager or from a local source, on the other hand, offers more granular control over the deployment of Office 365 ProPlus, including which applications and languages are installed on which client computers.
  
For more information, see [Plan your enterprise deployment of Office 365 ProPlus](plan-office-365-proplus.md). 
  
## Choose how often to update Office

With Office 365 ProPlus, you can control how frequently your users receive feature updates to their Office applications. For more information, see [Overview of update channels for Office 365 ProPlus](overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus.md).
  
## Plan for additional languages

You can install language accessory packs after you've deployed Office 365 ProPlusin one of its base languages. There are two ways to install language accessory packs:
  
- Have your users download and install the language accessory packs that they need from the Office 365 portal.
    
- Use the Office Deployment Tool to deploy the appropriate language accessory packs to your users.
    
For more information, see [Overview of deploying languages in Office 365 ProPlus](overview-of-deploying-languages-in-office-365-proplus.md).
  
## Special considerations

 **The Office Customization Tool is not used as part of the Office 365 ProPlus installation**. Instead, you can customize the installation for your users with the Office Deployment Tool. For more information, see [Overview of the Office Deployment Tool](overview-of-the-office-2016-deployment-tool.md).
  
 **Removal of InfoPath from Office 365 ProPlus**. InfoPath 2013 remains the current version and therefore isn't included in Office 365 ProPlus. When you upgrade an existing installation of Office 2007 to Office 365 ProPlus, InfoPath is removed from the computer. If your users still need to use InfoPath, the 2013 version of InfoPath is available for installation on the Software page in the Office 365 portal.
