# View software update status for Microsoft 365 Apps installations

> [!NOTE]
> This is pre-release documentation for a preview program that is subject to change and might not be available to everyone.

The **Software updates (Preview)** page in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/about-the-admin-center) displays a high-level overview of the installation status for Microsoft 365 Apps and Windows updates in your environment. Updates that contain security fixes are typically released on the second Tuesday of each month. Ensuring these updates are installed is important because they help protect you from known vulnerabilities. The **Software updates (Preview)** page allows you to easily determine the overall update compliance for your devices.

The **Software updates (Preview)** page has the following tabs to assist you in monitoring update status for your devices:

- **Microsoft 365 Apps**: Displays compliance charts for security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps.

- **Windows**: Displays compliance charts for cumulative updates and feature updates for Windows clients.

This article contains information about the **Microsoft 365 Apps** tab. For more information about the **Windows** tab, see [Microsoft admin center software updates (preview) page](/windows/deployment/update/update-status-admin-center).

## The Microsoft 365 Apps tab

To view the **Software updates (Preview)** page, sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center with your admin account, and then go to **Show all** > **Health** > **Software updates (Preview)**.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an entry for **Software updates (Preview)** in the menu, try going to this URL: https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/softwareupdates.

The **Microsoft 365 Apps** tab shows the following information about devices in your organization that have Microsoft 365 Apps installed:
- How many devices have the most recent security updates
- How many devices are missing one set of security updates
- How many devices are missing two or more sets of security updates

For devices that are behind on security updates, the **Microsoft 365 Apps** tab shows you how many security vulnerabilities those devices are potentially exposed to by not having the most current security updates.

The **Microsoft 365 Apps** tab doesn’t show the specific devices that are one or more builds behind. To see more detailed information about devices in your organization that have Microsoft 365 Apps installed, you can use the [inventory feature](../admincenter/inventory.md) available in the [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](https://config.office.com).

## Security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps

Security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps are released on the second Tuesday of each month. It’s important that you keep up to date with these security updates to help protect your organization from known security vulnerabilities. For a list of those security updates, see [Release notes for Microsoft Office security updates](/officeupdates/microsoft365-apps-security-updates).

To simplify update management and stay up to date with security updates, we recommend the following steps:
- Verify that Microsoft 365 Apps is configured to check for updates automatically
