# Custom reporting and database schema reference for Office Telemetry Dashboard

***Applies to:*** *Office 2019, Office 2016*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Office Telemetry Dashboard is no longer supported in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, starting with Version 2208, and will be removed starting with Version 2301.
> - For more information, see [Removal of Office Telemetry Dashboard from Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](telemetry-dashboard-removal.md).

The built-in worksheets in Office Telemetry Dashboard display lots of useful data, but sometimes you want more control over how the data is displayed. To do this, you can use the custom reporting feature in Office Telemetry Dashboard. This feature uses PivotTable reports to help give you a deeper view into how Office is being used in your organization. In this article, you can learn how to create custom reports, and you can find information about the database tables and fields that are used in custom reports.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Office Telemetry Dashboard is an on-premises tool that collects inventory, usage, and health data about the Office documents and solutions, such as add-ins, used in your organization. The data is primarily designed to help your organization with application compatibility testing.
> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is stored in a SQL Server database controlled by your organization and the data collected is ***not*** sent to Microsoft. For more information, see [Data collected by the agent for Office Telemetry Dashboard](data-that-the-telemetry-agent-collects-in-office.md).
> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is different than Office diagnostic data, which can be sent to Microsoft. For more information about Office diagnostic data, see [Overview of privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/overview-privacy-controls.md).
> - Settings used to manage Office Telemetry Dashboard have no impact on Office diagnostic data and vice versa. For more information about managing Office diagnostic data, see [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/manage-privacy-controls.md).

## Overview of custom reports in Office Telemetry Dashboard

The built-in worksheets in Office Telemetry Dashboard show you a relevant subset of the data that is collected by the agents. However, the built-in worksheets aren't customizable, and you might want to see a combined view of data that appears on different worksheets. This is where custom reporting can help you use PivotTable reports to view data in meaningful ways. 

For example, the following screenshot shows a custom report that lists the unregistered ActiveX controls that are detected on monitored clients. You can see that we've added fields to display the solution name, user name, and business group (as configured for Label 2 when the agents were deployed). This report helps us identify the solutions that use unregistered ActiveX controls and who is using them. In contrast, the **Documents** worksheet lists these solutions but doesn't have a column to indicate whether unregistered ActiveX controls are detected. You have to view the **Document sessions** worksheet for each document to see whether ActiveX controls are being used. 
  
**Custom report that shows unregistered ActiveX solutions**

![Illustrates a custom report that shows unregistered ActiveX controls.](../images/ORK_CustomReport_ActiveXreport.GIF)
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use labels in custom reports, you have to configure them when you deploy the agents. If you haven't already done this, we recommend that you carefully plan labels that support the types of custom reporting that you'll do. For example, setting labels to identify business groups, locations, and job roles can help you find trends and issues for specific groups or types of users. [Enabling and configuring the agent](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md#configure) will help you configure labels (known as **tags** in the Group Policy settings and registry settings for the agent). 
  
As another example, the following screenshot shows the list of Office client computers as displayed in the **Deployments** worksheet. This shows a high-level summary of Office deployments. But it doesn't give you a breakdown of how Office is deployed across business groups. 
  
**The Deployments worksheet**

![Shows the Office deployments that are tracked by Office Telemetry Dashboard in the Deployments worksheet.](../images/ORK_CR_OfficeDeployments.GIF)
  
You can get a more detailed view of Office clients by using a custom report. In the following illustration, the Office clients are grouped by business groups (as configured for Label 2) so that you can see the breakdown of Office deployments across each group. You can also create a PivotChart to help show the data. This custom report uses a hidden table, System_details, that you have to manually add before you can add Office versions to your report. You can learn how to do this in [Hidden tables in Office Telemetry Dashboard custom reports](custom-reporting-and-database-schema-reference-for-telemetry-dashboard.md#hidden_tables).

## Create custom reports in Office Telemetry Dashboard

You can create a single custom report on the **Custom report** worksheet. This automatically loads the default tables and creates a basic custom report that you can use as a starting point. Then, you can add and remove fields to design a report that meets your business needs. For performance reasons, not all tables are loaded automatically when you create a custom report. You can add tables by using the procedure in [Hidden tables in Office Telemetry Dashboard custom reports](custom-reporting-and-database-schema-reference-for-telemetry-dashboard.md#hidden_tables). The most common reason to add hidden tables is to gain access to Office builds, which are available in the **System_details** table. 
  
In this video demo, you can see custom reporting in action. We compare data that is shown in the **Solutions** worksheet to similar data that is shown in a custom report. This video will also help you learn how to add and move fields in a PivotTable report.

*Although this video is for an earlier version of Office, the information also applies to newer versions of Office.*
  
If you use large data sets in your custom reports, you might encounter the [2-GB memory limitation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=330482) when you use the 32-bit version of Excel. There are a couple ways that you can work around this limitation: 
  
- Use the 64-bit version of Excel, which doesn't have the 2-GB memory limitation, but does have other drawbacks. See [Choose between the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Office](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=250955) to learn more. 
    
- Adjust the reporting threshold in the database to change how much data is pulled into PowerPivot when custom reports are created, You can learn more about this setting in [How to configure privacy and performance settings in Office Telemetry Dashboard](manage-the-privacy-of-data-monitored-by-telemetry-in-office.md#Configure).
    
To create a custom report, you have to first start Office Telemetry Dashboard. The following table describes how to start the dashboard in different versions of Windows.

**Sample custom reports in Office Telemetry Dashboard**

To create a custom report that shows solution stability, do the following:
1. From the Lookup_solutions table, drag Solution name to the FILTERS well. 
2. After the Solution name field is added to the custom report, use the filter button (next to the Solution name) to choose the solution. 
3. From the Inventory table, drag Solution version to the ROWS well. 

![Illustrates a custom report that shows solution stability. The report includes the solution name, the versions of the solution, and the number of events for each version.](../images/ORK_CR_Solutionstability.PNG)

To create a custom report that shows Excel warnings, do the following: 
1. From the Lookup_issue_definitions table, drag Severity to the FILTERS well. 
2. After the Severity field is added to the custom report, use the filter button (next to Severity) to choose Warning. 
3. From the Lookup_solutions table, drag Application to the FILTERS well, and then adjust the filter to select Excel. 
4. From the Lookup_solutions table, drag File name to the ROWS well.

## Hidden tables in Office Telemetry Dashboard custom reports


Not all tables are loaded when you create a custom report. If you want to access additional data for your custom report, you can load the **Usage_summary**, **Issue_summary**, and **System_details** tables. Follow these steps to add these hidden tables to Office Telemetry Dashboard. 
  
### To add hidden tables to Office Telemetry Dashboard

1. Follow the steps in [Create custom reports in Office Telemetry Dashboard](custom-reporting-and-database-schema-reference-for-telemetry-dashboard.md#Create_customreport) to start Office Telemetry Dashboard, connect to the database, and create a custom report. 
    
2. After you create the custom report, select any area in the custom report. This makes the **ANALYZE** tab available on the ribbon. 
    
3. On the **ANALYZE** tab (under **PIVOTTABLE TOOLS**) on the ribbon, in the **Data** group, select **Change Data Source**, and then select **Connection Properties**.
    
4. In the **Workbook Connections for Custom report** dialog box, select **Telemetry Dashboard - Custom report**, select **Properties**, and then select the **Definition** tab. 
    
5. In the **Command text** box, add the following additional text (do not delete or overwrite the existing text): ,"Usage_summary", "Issue_summary", "System_details"
    
6. Choose **OK**, and on each dialog box, select **Close**.
    
7. In the **PivotTable Fields** list, Choose **ALL**, and then scroll down to see the newly added tables for **Usage_summary**, **Issue_summary**, and **System_details**. 
    
8. Right-click each new table, and choose **Show in Active Tab**. The new tables are added to the **Active** list under **PivotTable Fields** in the right column for easier access. 
    
The following tables list the hidden tables that you have to manually add to Office Telemetry Dashboard and describe the fields in the hidden tables.
