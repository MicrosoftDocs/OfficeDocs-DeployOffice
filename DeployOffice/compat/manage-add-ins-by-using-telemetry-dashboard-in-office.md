# Manage add-ins by using Office Telemetry Dashboard in Office

***Applies to:*** *Office 365 ProPlus, Office 2019, and Office 2016*

If you can prevent end users from running non-approved add-ins that might cause issues or slow performance, then you can reduce your support costs. If an add-in is crashing or takes a long time to load, you can disable the add-in for all Office client computers at the same time. Using Office Telemetry Dashboard, you can monitor add-in usage along with performance and other issues. With the collected data, you can decide which add-ins should be managed. This article points to more information about how to manage add-ins for Office by using Office Telemetry Dashboard.

By using the Group Policy Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) for Office, you can also create lists of managed add-ins and optionally block any add-in that isn't on the list. Users can't override these settings unless you allow them to.
