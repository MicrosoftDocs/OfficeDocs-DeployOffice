# Manage the privacy of data monitored by Office Telemetry Dashboard

***Applies to:*** *Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office 2019, and Office 2016*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Office Telemetry Dashboard will no longer be supported in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, starting with Version 2208 in August 2022. For more information, see [Removal of Office Telemetry Dashboard from Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](telemetry-dashboard-removal.md).


Office Telemetry Dashboard is an Excel workbook that displays compatibility and inventory data about the Office files, Office add-ins, and Office solutions that are used in an organization. Office Telemetry Dashboard displays the file names and titles of documents in each user's Most Recently Used list, which might reveal personal or confidential information about the user or organization. The names of add-ins and other solutions that are used by Office are also displayed. In this article, you can learn about settings in Office Telemetry Dashboard and the Office Telemetry Agent that help you protect user privacy by disguising file names and titles or by preventing data for selected applications or solutions from being reported altogether.

The agent collects inventory, usage, and health data and uploads it to a shared folder, where it is processed by a service named "Office Telemetry Processor" and inserted into an SQL database. Office Telemetry Dashboard connects to this database so that it can show the usage of Office files, add-ins, and solutions.

The agent is built into Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office 2019, Office 2016, and Office 2013 and is installed separately on computers that run earlier versions of Office. Regardless of whether it's built in or deployed separately, the agent never generates or collects any data until you enable logging. You can do this by using either the registry or the Group Policy Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) for Office as described in [Deploy Office Telemetry Dashboard](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md). After logging begins, data is stored on the local computer under %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Telemetry and is uploaded periodically to a shared folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Office Telemetry Dashboard is an on-premises tool that collects inventory, usage, and health data about the Office documents and solutions, such as add-ins, used in your organization. The data is primarily designed to help your organization with application compatibility testing.
> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is stored in a SQL Server database controlled by your organization and the data collected is ***not*** sent to Microsoft. For more information, see [Data collected by the agent for Office Telemetry Dashboard](data-that-the-telemetry-agent-collects-in-office.md).
> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is different than Office diagnostic data, which can be sent to Microsoft. For more information about Office diagnostic data, see [Overview of privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/overview-privacy-controls.md).
> - Settings used to manage Office Telemetry Dashboard have no impact on Office diagnostic data and vice versa. For more information about managing Office diagnostic data, see [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/manage-privacy-controls.md).

## How to configure privacy and performance settings in Office Telemetry Dashboard

There are several ways that you can configure the level of detail that is displayed for Office files, add-ins, and solutions in Office Telemetry Dashboard. Some methods, such as changing the reporting threshold, prevent certain information from being shown in Office Telemetry Dashboard. Other methods prevent the agent from uploading data so that it is never added to the database. Setting a threshold and preventing certain data from uploading can also help improve the performance of the database and custom reports.

The following image provides a quick overview of the three methods that Office Telemetry Dashboard provides to help you protect user privacy. 

**Three ways to configure privacy settings in Office Telemetry Dashboard**

![This diagram illustrates the 3 methods offered by Office Telemetry Dashboard to protect user privacy.](../images/ORK_Telem_3Methods.gif)

### Adjust the reporting threshold in the database to show only files that are used by multiple users

Office Telemetry Dashboard tracks the number of users who use an Office file that has the same name. Typically these are files that are shared and accessed by multiple users and might have greater business value than files that are used by a single user. As part of your compatibility planning, you might decide not to view inventory and compatibility events about files that are used by a single user and instead monitor files that are used throughout a department. Configuring Office Telemetry Dashboard to report files that are used by, say, three or more users also helps avoid displaying personal files, such as resumes. This setting also reduces the data set that is returned in custom reports in Office Telemetry Dashboard, which can help you work around the [2-GB memory limitation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=330482) in the 32-bit version of Excel. 

To prevent Office Telemetry Dashboard from displaying files that have a single author, you run a script that adjusts the minimum reporting threshold in the database. Specifically, you use the [Telemetry Dashboard Administration Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=281836) (Tdadm) to filter out files that appear on two or fewer clients. To do this, set the **Threshold** value to 3 (or to a larger value, if you want) as shown in the following example. 

```console
tdadm.exe -o settings -databaseserver dbserver -databasename dbname -threshold 3
```

For more information about Tdadm, see the [Tdadm wiki](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=281837).

### Disguise or obscure user and file data that is shown in Office Telemetry Dashboard

It's common for users in an organization to save Office files by using file names that contain sensitive or confidential information. Although these files might have high business value that justifies monitoring them for compatibility issues, business groups such as legal and human resources might object to having their computers monitored to avoid revealing confidential file names to administrators who use Office Telemetry Dashboard. 

To allow yourself and other administrators to identify the owners of Office files that have compatibility issues without revealing file names or specific locations, you can enable file obfuscation, which disguises Office file names, titles, and file paths. This setting is configured on the agent, which performs the obfuscation task before uploading data to the shared folder. The data that is stored on the local computer is not obfuscated.

The following table describes different ways in which file information is disguised.

**Examples of obfuscated file names, file paths, and titles**

Actual file details on the monitored client computer 

|Example|**File name**|**File path**|**Title**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|#1 |Resume_Contoso.xlsx  |C:\Users\John\Documents |Resume_Contoso.docx  |
|#2|Merger_Contoso.docx   |\\\FileShare\Operations\FY2018   |Merger_Contoso.docx   |
|#3|FY2018_Merger.xlsx   |https://sharepoint/sites/HR/SharedDocuments   |FY2018_Merger.xlsx   |
|#4 |10 cures for diseases.pptx   |Outlook:C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.Outlook\1234ABCD   |10 cures for diseases   |

Data that is sent to the shared folder after you enable file obfuscation

|Example|**File name**|**File path**|**Title**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|#1  |Re\*.xlsx   |C:\\*   |\*  |
|#2 |Me\*.docx   |\\\FileShare\\*   |\*   |
|#3 |FY\*.xlsx   |https://sharepoint/*   |\*   |
|#4|10\*.pptx   |Outlook:\*   |\*   |

#### To enable file obfuscation by using the registry

The following example enables file obfuscation in the registry of a client computer. Save this code sample as a .reg file and then run it on the monitored client computers.

```console
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\osm]
"EnableFileObfuscation"=dword:00000001
```

For more information about how to use .reg files, see [How to add, modify, or delete registry subkeys and values by using a registration entries (.reg) file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=200827).

#### To enable file obfuscation by using Group Policy settings

The following table describes the name and path of the Group Policy setting that enables file obfuscation. You can download the Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) for Office from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=626001).

**Group Policy setting that enables file obfuscation**

|**Setting name**|**Path**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Turn on privacy settings in Office Telemetry Agent  <br/> |User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Office 2016\Telemetry Dashboard  <br/> |

### Prevent certain applications or solutions from being reported in Office Telemetry Dashboard

For business groups that employ lawyers, executives, or other employees who work with trade secrets or sensitive data, you can prevent information about specific Office applications or Office solution types from being collected and uploaded to the shared folder. For example, a business group might decide that Excel files are too sensitive for monitoring. Another group might decide that they care only about Access-related solutions and that they don't want to monitor other applications.

#### To configure exclusion settings by using the registry

The following table describes the registry values that prevent specific applications from being reported to Office Telemetry Dashboard.

**Agent registry settings under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OSM\preventedapplications**

|**Value name**|**Value type**|**Value description and data**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|accesssolution  <br/><br/> olksolution  <br/><br/> onenotesolution  <br/> <br/>pptsolution  <br/> <br/>projectsolution  <br/> <br/>publishersolution  <br/><br/> visiosolution  <br/> <br/>wdsolution  <br/> <br/>xlsolution  <br/> |REG_DWORD  <br/> |Prevents data for specific Office applications from being reported to Office Telemetry Dashboard. The agent won't report any data that interacts with the specified application. This includes document files that are used by the application and COM add-ins that are loaded the application. The value names correspond to Office applications as follows: <br/> <br/> accesssolution: Access solutions  <br/><br/> olksolution: Microsoft Outlook solutions  <br/><br/> onenotesolution: OneNote solutions  <br/><br/> pptsolution: PowerPoint solutions  <br/><br/> projectsolution: Project solutions  <br/><br/> publishersolution: Publisher solutions <br/> <br/> visiosolution: Visio solutions  <br/><br/> wdsolution: Word solutions  <br/><br/> xlsolution: Excel solutions  <br/><br/> **Value:** <br/><br/> 1 = Prevent reporting <br/> <br/> 0 = Allow reporting <br/> <br/> Default = 0 (Allow reporting)  <br/> |

The following table describes the registry values that prevent specific solution types from being reported to Office Telemetry Dashboard.

**Agent registry settings under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OSM\preventedsolutiontypes**

|**Value name**|**Value type**|**Value description and data**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|agave  <br/> appaddins <br/> <br/> comaddins<br/>  <br/> documentfiles  <br/><br/> templatefiles  <br/> |REG_DWORD  <br/> |Prevents data for specific solutions from being reported to Office Telemetry Dashboard. The value names correspond to Office solution types as follows:  <br/> <br/>agave: apps for Office  <br/> <br/>appaddins: Application-specific add-ins. These include Excel add-ins such as .xla and xlam, Word add-ins such as .dotm, and PowerPoint add-ins such as .ppa and .ppam. <br/> <br/> comaddins: COM add-ins <br/> <br/> documentfiles: Office document files  <br/><br/> templatefiles: Office template files <br/> <br/> **Value:** <br/><br/> 1 = Prevent reporting <br/> <br/> 0 = Allow reporting  <br/><br/> Default = 0 (Allow reporting)  <br/> |

The following example disables reporting for all solution and application types. Save this sample as a .reg file and then remove any applications or solutions that you want to allow reporting for. Otherwise they will all be disabled because their value will be set to 00000001.

```console
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\microsoft\office\16.0\osm\preventedapplications]
"accesssolution"=dword:00000001
"olksolution"=dword:00000001
"onenotesolution"=dword:00000001
"pptsolution"=dword:00000001
"projectsolution"=dword:00000001
"publishersolution"=dword:00000001
"visiosolution"=dword:00000001
"wdsolution"=dword:00000001
"xlsolution"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\microsoft\office\16.0\osm\preventedsolutiontypes]
"agave"=dword:00000001
"appaddins"=dword:00000001
"comaddins"=dword:00000001
"documentfiles"=dword:00000001
