# XML file name extension reference for Office

***Applies to:*** *Office 2019, Office 2016*

XML file formats and their extensions are listed in the following tables for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Visio.
  
## XML file types for Word

The following table describes the file type, extension, and description for Word XML file formats.
  
**XML file types for Word**

|**Word file type**|**Extension**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Word Document  <br/> |.docx  <br/> |The default Word file format. Can't store VBA macro code.  <br/> |
|Strict Open XML document  <br/> |.docx  <br/> |Conforms to the Strict profile of the Open XML standard (ISO/IEC 29500). This profile of Open XML doesn't allow a set of features that were designed specifically for backward-compatibility with existing binary documents, as specified in Part 4 of ISO/IEC 29500.  <br/> |
|Word Macro-Enabled Document  <br/> |.docm  <br/> |Uses the same basic XML format as the Word document format, but can store VBA macro code. This file type is created when VBA macro code is present in the file.  <br/> |
|Word Template  <br/> |.dotx  <br/> |The default format for a Word template. Created when document styles and formatting are saved. Can't store VBA macro code.  <br/> |
|Word Macro-Enabled Template  <br/> |.dotm  <br/> |Stores macro code for use with other Word documents. Does not always contain macro code, but is configured to support the storage of macro code. Word documents created from a macro-enabled template do not inherit the VBAProject part of the template. By default, documents are saved as .docx files even when they are created from a Word macro-enabled template.  <br/> |
   

## XML file types for Excel

The following table describes the file type, extension, and description for Excel XML file formats.
  
**XML file types for Excel**

|Excel Add-In  <br/> |.xlam  <br/> |A supplemental program that runs additional code. Excel add-ins use the Open XML file format to store data, and they support using VBA projects and Excel 4.0 macro sheets.  <br/> |
