# Guide to Office Telemetry Dashboard resources

***Applies to:*** *Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office 2019, and Office 2016*

 > [!IMPORTANT]
> Office Telemetry Dashboard will no longer be supported in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, starting with Version 2208 in August 2022. For more information, see [Removal of Office Telemetry Dashboard from Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](telemetry-dashboard-removal.md). 
 
The following table describes resources that are available to IT Professionals who are assessing Office compatibility by using the Office Telemetry Dashboard.
  
|Area|More information|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Start here** <br/> | Read [Assess Office compatibility](assess-office-compatibility.md) to learn about the four key phases in the compatibility process. <br/> <br/> Thinking about deploying the 64-bit version of Office? Be sure to carefully review [Choose between the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Office](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=250955) before you decide.  <br/>  |
|**Deploy and configure Office Telemetry Dashboard** <br/> |Before you can start to collect Office inventory, usage, and health data, you must [Deploy Office Telemetry Dashboard](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md). Be sure to [review our topology and hardware guidance](plan-telemetry-dashboard-deployment.md) before you roll out the components. If you're setting up a small or test environment, we have a script that will [quickly set up Office Telemetry Dashboard on a single computer](/samples/browse/?redirectedfrom=TechNet-Gallery). You can [deploy agents](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md#agent) by using your preferred deployment method. This can include [deploying agents by using Microsoft Configuration Manager](/archive/blogs/office_resource_kit/deploy-telemetry-agent-by-using-system-center-configuration-manager).  <br/><br/> You'll need to [update the Office Telemetry Dashboard components](update-office-telemetry-components-for-office-2016.md) if you're moving from an Office 2013 installation of Office Telemetry Dashboard.  <br/><br/> Having trouble getting data into the dashboard? You can [troubleshoot Office Telemetry Dashboard deployments](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md#tshooting).  <br/><br/> If you're concerned about maintaining user privacy for the data that is collected, you can [manage privacy settings](manage-the-privacy-of-data-monitored-by-telemetry-in-office.md) and [see the list of data that is collected](data-that-the-telemetry-agent-collects-in-office.md). If, for any reason, you must [delete the local data on a client computer](manage-the-privacy-of-data-monitored-by-telemetry-in-office.md#Delete), you can do that, too.  <br/><br/> To manage the database, [download the Telemetry Dashboard Administration Tool (Tdadm)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=281836). You can use this tool to clean up unused user, solution, and computer data, or to copy or move data to another database. [Visit the Tdadm wiki](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=281837) for usage information.  <br/><br/>  **IMPORTANT:** <br/> - Office Telemetry Dashboard is an on-premises tool that collects inventory, usage, and health data about the Office documents and solutions, such as add-ins, used in your organization. The data is primarily designed to help your organization with application compatibility testing. <br/> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is stored in a SQL Server database controlled by your organization and is ***not*** sent to Microsoft. For more information, see [Data collected by the agent for Office Telemetry Dashboard](data-that-the-telemetry-agent-collects-in-office.md).<br/> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is different than Office diagnostic data, which can be sent to Microsoft. For more information about Office diagnostic data, see [Overview of privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/overview-privacy-controls.md).<br/> - Settings used to manage Office Telemetry Dashboard have no impact on Office diagnostic data and vice versa. For more information about managing Office diagnostic data, see [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/manage-privacy-controls.md).  |
|**Use Office Telemetry Dashboard** <br/> |This [video about Office Telemetry Dashboard navigation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=271138) will help you start Office Telemetry Dashboard, connect to the database, and view the data collected. You can then use Office Telemetry Dashboard to [monitor Office stability and deployment status](monitor-office-compatibility-and-deployments-by-using-telemetry-dashboard.md). You can also use Office Telemetry Dashboard to [manage add-ins in Office](/archive/blogs/office_resource_kit/lets-manage-add-ins-using-telemetry-dashboard). If you aren't sure what the data in a worksheet means, [take a look at our reference guide](telemetry-dashboard-worksheet-reference.md), which describes each worksheet. Want to customize how data is displayed in the dashboard? No problem! [Creating custom reports in Office Telemetry Dashboard](custom-reporting-and-database-schema-reference-for-telemetry-dashboard.md) is easy. [Watch this video](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=296456) to see custom reporting in action. <br/> <br/> *(Although these videos are for an earlier version of Office, the information also applies to newer versions of Office.)* <br/> <br/> Is your dashboard empty? The agents can require to four hours to start transmitting data. You can speed up this process by [triggering data collection manually](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md#trigger). You might also want to [troubleshoot Office Telemetry Dashboard deployments](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md#tshooting).  <br/> |
|**Troubleshoot Office documents and custom solutions** <br/> |Ready to troubleshoot issues with Office documents and custom solutions? You'll want to [use Office Telemetry Log ](/office/client-developer/shared/troubleshooting-office-files-and-custom-solutions-with-the-telemetry-log) to do this troubleshooting. The log [displays compatibility issues](/office/client-developer/shared/compatibility-issues-in-office) for Word, Excel, and Outlook. To see how the log works, you can [download sample Office documents that trigger compatibility events ](/archive/blogs/office_resource_kit/sample-office-documents-for-testing-office-telemetry) in the log. <br/> |
