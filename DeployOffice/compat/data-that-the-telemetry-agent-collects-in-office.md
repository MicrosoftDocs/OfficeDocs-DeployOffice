# Data collected by the agent for Office Telemetry Dashboard

***Applies to:*** *Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office 2019, and Office 2016*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Office Telemetry Dashboard will no longer be supported in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, starting with Version 2208 in August 2022. For more information, see [Removal of Office Telemetry Dashboard from Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](telemetry-dashboard-removal.md).
  
The Office Telemetry Dashboard uses an agent to collect several types of inventory, usage, and health data for installations of Office, such as the following:
  
- The file names of Office files that are in the Most Recently Used list.
- The names of add-ins and solutions that interact with Office.
- System information such as user name and computer name.
    
The agent collects different kinds of information for different applications as applicable. For example, for Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word, the agent collects data that allows you to determine:
  
- Whether the document has specific metadata for a particular file, such VBA macros, data connections, or ActiveX controls.
- Whether the document has encountered compatibility issues or critical errors while it is being used.
- How Office files and solutions are used on a user's computer. Data of this type that is gathered by the agent is referred to as session data. 
    
The agent doesn't collect any of the following kinds of information:
  
- The contents of files.
- Information about files that are not in the Most Recently Used list.
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Office Telemetry Dashboard is an on-premises tool that collects inventory, usage, and health data about the Office documents and solutions, such as add-ins, used in your organization. The data is primarily designed to help your organization with application compatibility testing.
> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is stored in a SQL Server database controlled by your organization and the data collected is ***not*** sent to Microsoft. For more information, see [Data collected by the agent for Office Telemetry Dashboard](data-that-the-telemetry-agent-collects-in-office.md).
> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is different than Office diagnostic data, which can be sent to Microsoft. For more information about Office diagnostic data, see [Overview of privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/overview-privacy-controls.md).
> - Settings used to manage Office Telemetry Dashboard have no impact on Office diagnostic data and vice versa. For more information about managing Office diagnostic data, see [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/manage-privacy-controls.md).
