If users save in filtered HTML and then re-open the file in an Office application, text and general appearance are preserved. However, some features might work differently.  <br/> |

Users can also open documents in the .odt format in Word 2019, Word 2016, and Word 2013. Formatting might be lost when users save and open .odt files.  <br/> |
|.pdf  <br/> |PDF  <br/> |Portable Document Format (PDF), a PostScript-based electronic file format that was developed by Adobe Systems.

When the XPS file is viewed online or printed, it keeps exactly the format that users intended, and the data in the file can't be easily changed.  <br/> <br/> You can use Word 2019, Word 2016, or Word 2013 to save documents in the XPS Document file format, but you can't open them by using Word 2019, Word 2016, or Word 2013.  <br/> |

### Opening or viewing unsupported file formats

If the file format that users want to use isn't supported, they can try the following methods to open the file.
  
- Search the internet for a company that makes file format converters for file formats that aren't supported in the application.
    
- Save to a file format that another program supports. For example, users might want to import their Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file into another program that doesn't support the application's native file format. However, the other program might support importing another supported file format, such as a text file format. In this case, users can save their work in text file format, and then from the other program, import the text file.
