## Learn about the Office Telemetry Dashboard worksheets

The following table briefly describes the primary worksheets in Office Telemetry Dashboard. For more detailed information about the worksheets, see [Office Telemetry Dashboard worksheet reference](telemetry-dashboard-worksheet-reference.md).
  
**Overview of Office Telemetry Dashboard worksheets**

|**Worksheet name**|**Purpose**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Overview  <br/> |Provides a quick view of the health of Office documents and solutions and a view of deployment trends. The links on this worksheet help you investigate Office compatibility and stability issues in your organization.  <br/> |
|Documents  <br/> |Helps you investigate which Office documents are the most heavily used and identify documents that are experiencing issues.  <br/> <br/>This worksheet shows Office documents that were detected in the Most Recently Used (MRU) files in the local registry of monitored clients that run Office and earlier supported versions of Office.  <br/> <br/>The list also contains load events for monitored clients that run Office. Select any of the value links to open a worksheet that provides more detail. For example, in the **Total Users** column, you can select any number to view the users who have that file in their MRU list.  <br/> |
|Solutions  <br/> |Shows details about solutions, such as COM add-ins, that were detected on monitored computers. This worksheet also shows data about load events on monitored client computers that run Office.  <br/> <br/>Check the **Critical** column for a count of the number of unique users who have hit critical errors that the solutions are causing on Office clients. By reviewing critical errors and the number of users affected, you can decide whether to forcibly block add-ins that are crashing for many users. To do so, choose the **Add-in management mode** link at the top of the worksheet.  <br/> <br/>You can also investigate performance issues that might be causing a solution to take a longer time to load than expected on some computers. The load time values that are displayed in this worksheet are statistical averages. Select on of the value links to see individual user load times for a particular document.  <br/> |
|Telemetry Processor  <br/> |Lists the servers that run a processor, the number of users and computers that are monitored, and the date and time of the last update.  <br/> |
|Deployments  <br/> |Lists the versions of Office that are detected and other details, such as architecture type and number of unique instances of each version.  <br/> |
|Custom report  <br/> |Helps you to create a PivotTable report so that you can customize how you view the data in Office Telemetry Dashboard. Create a custom report if the **Documents** and **Solutions** worksheets don't display data in the way that you want to view it. To learn more, see [Custom reporting and database schema reference for Office Telemetry Dashboard](custom-reporting-and-database-schema-reference-for-telemetry-dashboard.md). <br/> |

## Use filters to adjust what's shown in an Office Telemetry Dashboard worksheet

In the navigation pane on the left side of the dashboard, there are filters called **Label1**, **Label2**, **Label3**, **Label4**, **Date range**, and **View**. You can use these filters to change the scope of the data that is shown in a worksheet. Any time that you change a filter, you must select the **Refresh** button ![An image of the button on the Office Telemetry Dashboard that refreshes the data in the content pane.](../images/ORK_Telem_RefreshIcon.png) to refresh the data in the content pane. The **Refresh** button is located in the upper-right corner of most worksheets. When you refresh the data, the sorting order is automatically reset. You can verify when the content pane was last updated by referring to the time stamp that is located below the **Refresh** button on the navigation pane. 
  
**Label filters**
- Use the **Label** filters to filter data by department, location, or deployment group. These filters are available for most worksheets.
- The **Label** filters are populated by data that is specified in the \<TAG\> fields when you deploy the agent on client computers. For more information on how to set these fields, see [Office Telemetry Agent](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md#agent).

  ![An image of the label drop down box on the Office Telemetry Dashboard's navigation pane.](../images/ORK_Telem_Label1.png)


**Date range filter**
- Use the **Date range** filter to choose the date range for the data that you want to view. This helps you watch trends over longer periods of time, or drill down and find more recent data for analysis.
- The graphs on the **Overview** worksheet, such as **Documents and Solutions stability** and **Office deployment trend**, show data that extends back to four times the selected date range in the navigation pane. This provides better context when you graphically display the data and trends for analysis. For longer date ranges, there might be a small delay before the results are displayed in the content pane.
- The **Overview** worksheet supports changing the date range to **Last 7 days**, **Last 1 month**, or **Last 3 months**. A snapshot of the database is taken every evening at midnight (local server time). It is used to compose the graphs and data that are shown on the **Overview** worksheet. Therefore, the **Overview** worksheet isn't real-time, but is, instead, based on nightly snapshots.

  ![An image of the Date Range drop down box in the Office Telemetry Dashboard's navigation pane.](../images/ORK_Telem_DateRange.png)

**View filter**
- The **View** filter on the **Documents** and **Solutions** worksheets allows you to select pre-scoped views that help you analyze data. Here are the options that you can choose from:
  - **Frequently used** displays all documents or solutions that were used within the selected date range, sorted by total number of users.
  - **Frequently used by Office 2016 and later** displays all documents or solutions that were used by Office within the selected range, sorted by total number of users of Office.
  - **Attention items** displays all documents or solutions that have critical issues that were found within the selected date range.
  - **Stability - Top 400/100** displays the documents (up to 400) or solutions (up to 100) that have success rates that are less than the target threshold (95% for documents, 99.9% for solutions).


<a name="stability"> </a>

## Determine the overall stability of Office documents and solutions throughout your organization

The **Overview** worksheet allows you to quickly understand how your critical documents and solutions (add-ins) are behaving on users' computers. Instead of browsing the **Documents** and **Solutions** worksheets, which show you item-by-item status, you can open and refresh the **Overview** worksheet to see a high-level view of document and solution stability. 
  
The following screenshot shows the **Overview** worksheet. 
  
**The Overview worksheet in Office Telemetry Dashboard**

![A screenshot of the main Overview worksheet view on the Office Telemetry Dashboard.](../images/ORK_Telem_OverviewWSmain.png)
  
The four numbers that are highlighted at the top of the content pane show the number of stable and unstable documents and solutions. If you see a high unstable count, you should investigate to find out what is occurring. 
  
The metrics for stable versus unstable are calculated by determining whether the documents or solutions have success rates that meet the following thresholds: 
  
- 95% for documents
    
- 99.9% for solutions
    
If a document or solution meets these thresholds, they are considered stable. If they don't meet these thresholds, they are considered unstable. The success rate is determined by the percentage of sessions where the document or solution operated without encountering a critical issue. The critical issues that are tracked by Office Telemetry include application crashes, Office object model calls that would definitively fail for compatibility reasons, and more. A session is defined by the opening of a document or solution or an elapsed 24-hour period where the document is open. 
  
You can use the filters in the navigation pane to focus on specific business groups in your organization or customized date ranges. For example, you might want to know how well the new Sales reporting solutions for Office are performing since their deployment last month. You can select the **Last 1 month** date range, and the appropriate **Label** for the Sales team's computers. After you select **Refresh**, the **Overview** worksheet view shows you a high-level view of document and solution stability for the Sales team's Office deployments. From there, you can decide your next steps. 
  
In addition, the **Overview** worksheet view provides a summary of the top 400 frequently used documents and the top 100 frequently used solutions. Research indicates that these numbers represent the average number of documents and solutions in any given enterprise department that are frequently used. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Built-in documents and solutions that are provided by Microsoft aren't included in the top documents and solutions counts that are displayed on the **Overview** worksheet. 
  
<a name="investigate"> </a>

## Drill down to investigate unstable documents or solutions that require your attention

After you know the number of unstable documents and solutions, you can drill into the details. On the **Overview** worksheet, select a value to see a detailed list of stable or unstable documents or solutions. The following graphic shows how to view the unstable documents by selecting the corresponding value ( **23**) on the **Overview** worksheet. 
  
**How to choose a value on the Overview worksheet to see unstable documents**

![A screenshot of a drill down Overview worksheet showing stable and unstable document statistics.](../images/ORK_Telem_OverviewUnstable1.gif)
  
After you click the link for unstable documents, the **Documents** worksheet appears. The worksheet is filtered to show the 23 unstable documents. The following screenshot shows an example of this filtered view. Although it isn't obvious in the screenshot, only 23 documents are listed, sorted by most unstable. 
  
**Unstable documents that are shown in the Documents worksheet**

![A screenshot of a 2nd level drill down Overview worksheet showing details for unstable documents.](../images/ORK_Telem_OverviewUnstable2.png)
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember that when you select a link on the **Overview** worksheet to see details about documents or solutions, the contents pane displays a filtered view. Select the message bar at the top of the header pane to see the full list of all items for that worksheet. 
  
Back on the **Overview** worksheet, under the stable and unstable counts, you can see the trend charts that show how these counts increased or decreased over past periods. If you see the trend line pointing down to indicate a decline in stability, this indicates that recent changes are triggering issues for your documents and solutions. As shown in the following screenshot, the date range that is displayed in the trend chart shows an expanded range that is four times longer than the selected date range. This provides better context to view the overall trend data.

## View the progress of Office deployments in your organization

You can track your overall Office deployment progress by looking at the chart at the lower part of the **Overview** worksheet. This shows the number of users who are running each Office version and how the Office deployments have changed over time. By using this chart, you can quickly check the deployment status and share progress with your stakeholders. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The date range that is displayed in the deployment trend chart shows an expanded range that is four times longer than the selected date range. This provides better context to view the overall trend data. 
  
The following image shows an example of the Office deployment trend chart on the **Overview** worksheet.
