Good for posting on a site or editing with Microsoft Office FrontPage or another HTML editor.  <br/> |
|.htm, .html  <br/> |Web Page, Filtered  <br/> |Saving in the Web Page, Filtered file format removes Microsoft Office-specific tags. If users save in filtered HTML and then reopen the file in an Office application, text and general appearance are preserved. However, some features might work differently.  <br/> |

|.rtf  <br/> |Rich Text Format  <br/> |RTF controls the representation and formatting of a document, both on the screen and in print.

|.wps  <br/> |Works 6-9 Document  <br/> |This is the default file format of Microsoft Works, versions 6.0 through 9.0.  <br/> |
|.xml  <br/> |Word 2003 XML Document  <br/> |The XML format supported in Office Word 2003.  <br/> |

### Opening or viewing unsupported file formats

If the file format that users want to use isn't supported, they can try the following methods to open the file.
  
- Search the internet for a company that makes file format converters for file formats that aren't supported in the application.
    
- Save to a file format that another program supports. For example, users might want to import their Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file into another program that doesn't support the application's native file format. However, the other program might support importing another supported file format, such as a text file format. In this case, users can save their work in text file format, and then from the other program, import the text file.
