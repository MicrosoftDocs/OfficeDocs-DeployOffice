# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Modify user settings

**Applies to:** *Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016*

**Summary**: Sets the default values of Office application settings for users who install Office with this customization file.
  
1. To configure an application's settings, in the left pane, expand the application folder and subfolders until the setting you want to configure is listed in the details pane.

    You can select **Show all settings** to display all available application settings, or select **Show configured settings only** to display only those settings that have previously been configured and saved to this configuration file.

2. Choose the setting to display information at the bottom of this page that explains how this setting can be configured.

3. To configure the setting, double-click the setting that you want to configure, and then select **Not Configured**, **Enabled**, or **Disabled**. Each of these choices can have a different effect on the setting, and each is explained in the information displayed on the bottom of this page when a setting is selected.

   - **Not configured** - The setting remains as it is.

   - **Enabled** - The setting is modified based on your choices in the dialog box.

   - **Disabled** - The setting is disabled. Disabling an option may be different from not configuring the option. See the description of the specific option for more details.

4. From this dialog box, you can move through the list of settings by choosing **Previous Setting** or **Next Setting**.

5. Choose **OK**.

6. Select **Migrate user settings** to preserve the user's custom settings from a previous version of Office. If you modify user settings and also select this check box, Setup first applies the modified settings and then migrates the user's existing custom settings, overwriting any conflicting settings.

> [!NOTE]
> When you select **Enabled** to view the options for a setting and choose **OK**, **Previous Setting**, or **Next Setting**, the status changes to **Configured**, even if you do not change the setting. Inadvertently configuring the setting with an empty hyperlink, path, or file name can cause errors. If you selected **Enabled** and want to ignore your changes or avoid configuring the setting, choose **Cancel**. You can also return a setting to the **Not Configured** state by double-clicking the setting, selecting **Not Configured**, and then choosing **OK**.
