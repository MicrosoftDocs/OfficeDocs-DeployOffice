# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Specify Send/Receive Groups

**Applies to:** *Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016*

**Summary**: Define Send/Receive groups for Exchange accounts and folders, and specify the tasks that are performed on each group during a Send/Receive in Outlook.
  
A Send/Receive group contains a collection of Outlook accounts and folders. You can specify different options for Send/Receive groups when Outlook is online and offline.
  
- **Do not configure Send/Receive settings** - Don't configure settings for Send/Receive groups. Outlook is configured with only the All Accounts group and its default settings. If users have created additional groups, those groups migrate when users upgrade to Outlook.

- **Configure Send/Receive settings** - Configure settings for Send/Receive groups (Exchange accounts and folders only).

    - Choose **New** to create a new group of accounts and folders.

    - Choose **Modify** to specify or redefine options for a Send/Receive group.

    - Choose **Rename** to change the name of an existing Send/Receive group.

    - Choose **Remove** to remove an existing Send/Receive group.

**Send/Receive settings for the selected group**
  
Specify settings for the Send/Receive group selected in the list. (The name of the selected group appears in the option label.) You can specify different settings for when Outlook is online or offline.
  
When Outlook is online:
  
- **Include this group in Send/Receive** - Execute a Send/Receive action on this group when the user chooses **Send/Receive**.

- **Schedule an automatic Send/Receive every n minutes** - Type the number of minutes you want between automatic Send/Receive actions.

- **Perform an automatic Send/Receive when exiting** - Automatically execute a Send/Receive action for this group when the user exits Outlook.

When Outlook is offline:
  
- **Include this group in Send/Receive** - Execute a Send/Receive action on this group when the user chooses **Send/Receive**.

- **Schedule an automatic Send/Receive every n minutes** - Choose the interval between each Send/Receive action.

Exchange address book:
  
- **Download offline address book** - Download the offline address book when the user chooses **Send/Receive**.

- Choose **Address Book Settings** to open the **Modify Address Book Settings** dialog box. You can select **Download changes since last Send/Receive** to download only updates to the address book since the last download, and you can choose whether to download **Full Details** or **No Details**.
