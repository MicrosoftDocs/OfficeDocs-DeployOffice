# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Remove previous installations

**Applies to:** *Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016*

**Summary**: Specifies previous versions of Office applications to keep or remove.
  
This option only applies when Office is first installed on a user's computer. By default, Setup removes all previous versions of Office applications. To keep an installed Office application, complete the following steps:
  
1. Select **Remove the following earlier versions of Microsoft Office programs**.

2. Select the Office application that you don't want to remove, and then choose **Details**.

3. Under **Choose which earlier versions you want Setup to remove**, clear the check box, and then choose **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> Outlook 2016 cannot coexist with previous versions of Outlook. If you choose to keep a previous version, do not install Outlook 2016.
