The [Office Deployment Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49117) (ODT) is available for free from the Microsoft Download Center. Always download and use the latest version of the ODT.

After downloading the Office Deployment Tool, double-click the officedeploymenttool executable (.exe) file to extract the ODT files. The extracted files will include setup.exe and a sample configuration.xml.

The setup.exe file is the ODT and is a command-line tool. The configuration.xml file is a sample that helps you get started. Use the configuration.xml file to specify settings for the ODT when downloading or installing Office. This file is a simple XML file that can be created and edited in any text editor, such as Notepad. You can name the file anything you prefer, as long as it retains the .xml file extension.
